In my first review given within 24 hrs l found it amazing but after 10 days of usage l can say it is full of bugs; l checked my return window it passed on 3rd Aug ; l regret to choose one plus over samsung.. sooner l have to exchange or throw this mobile if bugs not fixed.One plus no never purchase; frustrated with this mobile.
"First of all I would like to tell you that i won't be giving a very technical review like those on ytube videos. I am gonna give a very honest review as a general phone user just like all of you only. This is my first phone for a price above 20k so i thought and researched a lot before buying. I was confused between buying iphone 12 and Nord 2 I know the price difference is more but still I won't go for above 50k to buy any phone other than Iphone. But honestly man i think at 30k this 1+ nord 2 is really astonishing. You don't need to go for one plus 9 or other higher range phones of one plus or else if you have some extra bucks in pocket which u just wanna spend.So I will be telling u the pros and cons of this phone very honestly after 3-4 days of very vigorous usage.Pros:1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models.2. The display is just great.3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz.4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now.5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guys😂and it actually feels elegant. So you need not do the hectic work of searching for back covers after buying a phone and infact the scratch guard which they have put on the screen is quite handy.. I don't think u need to put a temper guard if u handle ur phone well, anyways thats your choice..for me i m gonna go with the scratch guard for some weeks or may be month n lets see how it goes..for now about a week it feels to be performing just outstanding.So i wont be telling u more features of this phone as u can read'em anywhere in its specifications.I will tell you some 'X-Factors of Nord 2. And why you should decide to buy this phone1. The charging time.. I was like whtt!! When the phone shootes up from 0% to 85% in just about 30mins and upto 100% in around 40-45 mins...So the warp charging is just out of world @65W charger. Never ever saw this in any phone.2. The stereo speakers. When i played the first song i was just shocked what i just heard. Yes it actually feels to be giving a 3D feel of sound. Actually sound comes out of speakers on bottom right as well as speakers on top of screen which are meant to be for calling purpose only in other phones .So this phone just rocked here. 3. The camera just performs outstanding in low light, dark or even very dark sorroundings.To check it I went on to my terrace and clicked a picture in dark which you can see yourself..i have put it here. 4. The phone buid really feels premium.Some of the cons or I won't say cons..bcz I don't really feel them as cons.as u can ignore them over the astonishing features of this phone..but since we can't go away without mentioning some cons so here are some.1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable.Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it.2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actually😂 Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here.So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2."
"Received my unit 4hr ago and here is what I think-1. Feels sturdy and premium in hand.2. 90hz looks absolutely fine, you won't miss 120hz3. In normal usage, the phone did not heat.4. Charged from 20-100% in just 15-20mins. My mind was blow away.5. Cameras- I didn't use it much but a sample image is attached which I took from the primary rear camera. So far it looks good to me.6. UI is clean but there were a lot of permissions which I had to accept to use the basic things like camera, search in the drawer. It clearly says in the policy that it shares my data. I believe we cannot do much about this.This is my initial impression, will update accordingly in the future."
I got OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone delivered yesterday. While setting up Phone got an update and updated my phone. Some bugs needs to be fixed by OnePlus team. Below are some findings.1. Charging time of this phone from 21% to 100% took  auround 16 minutes which is good but at the same time battery is draining too fast after 2 hours battery was 31%. As I am not heavy user of this phone but still battery drained fast.2. While installing apps or updating apps I get error message stating that my storage is full and need to remove unused apps. I purchased 256 gb internal storage and had 217 gb free storage.3. While I was using flipkart app I noticed that after 12 seconds app closes automatically and I need to reopen again and again after every 12 seconds. This is very annoying.Please think before you buy this phone.
"7/28:Received this yesterday and first impression from look and feel was great.Was waiting for some reviews but will go first on this one, havent tried camera yet and should not as I moved from a Pixel 5 to this one. Purely for sake of google not providing dual apps even with eSim option.Things went south1) The mobile heated up a bit even during data transfer done via One plus switch App.2) VLC, gallery kept crashing. Videos will stop in middle and close, gallery will crash while you scroll on pictures.3) Few things are hard to find, not sure why camera need so many permission just to let you open it.4) Then came a update today morning and it hit the app cloner seems. Even with FB, Insta and WA on mobile, its not able to see it. I even reinstalled those to see if it picks it up.Seems like a half baked product with lack of testing rolled out to market. We are the test users.Product is overall okay and not my first one plus device. Just a bit of let down to start with and will have to wait on how soon these issues are sorted.Update 7/31:------------------ App cloner is showing apps now. However below apps continue to crash- Camera- whatsapp- youtuebe- Spotify- shuttle .  Ruined Android auto as well.I am sure list is long, but these are ones tried today and it's pathetic."
I bought one plus phone for the first time and i am very disappointed with it..
There are heating issues with average usage. Battery drains very fast.
Bad experience with this from the moment it received.Mobile hangs and slow while the initial startup.Device not working properly and restarts several times automatically.App clone not working and I have the apps in my mobile it mentioned in the app clone but it doesn't showing anything to clone.Normal whatsapp chat drive backup not working... My old whatsapp backups are gone😡😡😡.Very bad and worst experience with OnePlus..
Very bad phone. Over heating for reason. Even i dont play games. 😭😭 I want return it. Battery drain too fast. Only give backup of 2-3 hours. Plz Amazon help. My 30000 get waste. It's not even 24hours. My old realme narzo is better than this
"Ridiculous experience. My phone comes with dent, didn't expected from amazon and seller."
"I am writing this review after using this Mobile from Last 14days. I know the confusion of a person who is going to spend Big amount of money on mobile. I gone through the same phase and I willl try to give my honest review about OnePlus nord 2 and cover all the aspects of it. I will make sure that after reading this review you will easily make your decision.1) Camerarear camera : 5/5front camera : 4/5Awesome Rear camera with 50MP main perform super. I have attached images for reference. Focus is very fast and dynamic range is also Plus point.front camera is also good buy note best but I can say that over-all it's good in this price range.So many users are complaining about colour os code merge into oxygen os but I feel that camera quality is improved due to this. camera features are well organized compare to only oxygen os.2) software experience : 5/5It's awesome experience for me as I am coming from MIUI ( redmi note 4 ). Clean UI without any bloatware and ads.3) Performance : 5/5All applications are working very smoothly. I never encounter any lagging issues till now.  I didn't play havey games on it so I am not aware about gaming performance. over-all I can say ""Phone makkhan ki tarah chalta hy"".4) charging time : 5/5super fast charging.5) Face recognition Speed : 5/5it's very very fast similar to charging Speed.6) Fingerprint sensor Speed : 4/57) Battery Life : 4/5It's give you 6-7 hours screen on time which is  good. For me Full charging Last for 1.5 days.8) Carrier Aggregation and network quality : 5/59) Look  : 5/5when you hold it on your hands it's look very primium Mobile. I have grey colour which comes with Matt finish.10) Ram management : 3/5This is bit disappointing part in OnePlus nord 2. I think this will improve after software update so no need to worry. 11) Heating issueYes Mobile is heating bit when you use continuesoly for long time. But this is classical OnePlus issue and It can be solve through software update.12) Haptic feedback : 5/513) Display : 5/514) speaker : 5/5dual speakers with High loudness makes is awesome 😎conclusion :If you are normal user and looking for well balance Phone in all aspects then OnePlus nord 2 made for  you in this price range. Just buy it and please don't forget to Thank me later 🙂"
Hi All. I have purchased OP Nord 2 for upgrade from my two years old Realme X. But my experience with Nord 2 is very bad. first its display is very bad quality compare to smartphone at 30k range. Even my Realme x display looking good against Nord 2. Its major highlight camera also very poor quality nowhere near to flagship sensor as OP advertising. Daylight pics are pathetic. After system update App Clone function is not working not able to use my 2nd whats app account. Call Recording function is not working which is my main requirement that is working flawless in my realme x. I think OnePlus make fool of us. Everyone who is purchasing will regret afterwards. So beware of OP Nord 2.
"Nord 2 software is full of bugs.Clone app is not working after the last update. The ones who had installed lost their data. Fix is expected in the next build, however, one is not sure when that would be available.So, if one is using dual apps, then think twice. I still need to carry my old phone as dual app is not working.Also, OnePlus care(support) has no clue about extended warranty. Paid for extended warranty, 4 days have passed since then but one plus support has no clue.Photo access from gallery is very slow. If one is having hundreds of photos in gallery then pictures take time to load when scrolling through them. Even my previous 2 year old phone fared way better.Software optimization is lacking."
The phone overall is great but the OS has lots of bugs. Like its not even 1 day but I had the cloner app installed for Whatsapp which suddenly gets removed after latest update. It shows that no app is installed for which cloner is applicable. I would expect Oneplus to have their software sorted out if they are targeting the premium range users.
I believed in one plus and bought this but camera clarity is below the mark..no light enhancement photos are very dull..not worth it at all
Using it since 2 days and facing so much problems. Restarts automatically in Recovery Mode. Too much bugs in Oxygen OS. Not able to clone app inspite having required Apps. Not happy at all. Seems that I have spent my money for a 3rd class category phone.
-The refresh rate is just awesome-Camera is fabulous-Gaming is excellent-65 Watt charger charges in 38 minutes-Display is soothing-Color is just wow.. nothing like before.-Wow dealIn short it is the best android launch of 2021
Battery drains fast 😑Superb charging speed (0to 100) 33 mins🤗Display goodBack camera thumps upFront camera quite week😦Brightness okay!!
I was very excited once I received the phone.But i dont know why the phone switched off by itself after 4hrs of usage and never started again. Can be poor quality of the oneplus new series. Now a days oneplus is not working well for its customers
I am using one plus 5t currently ..Ordered one plus Nord 2 to upgrade my existing phone. Trust me the display of this Nord 2 looks like a cheap smartphone. Colours of one plus 5t are way nice and better. One plus is losing its credibility and brand value . Looks like a cheap smartphone. Using Nord 2 don't give a premium feel.
Splendid in style
"Display is good, camera is average , speaker quality is everage , I am not a gamer so I can't measure performance, but definitely I can say it gives worst battery performance ,it gives 3-4 hours sreen on time although it charged the battery in 30-35 mmonutes , overall I am very disappointed 😞😞😞😞"
The phone's good but I don't know why my apps keep getting closed automatically. I am a little disappointed with this behavior. It happens randomly. I don't expect this kind of nonsense with a 30k device.
"Delivered yesterday and initial impressions was good . But then when i enrolled my finger print that's when the issue started. The phone wasn't able to read the fingerprint at all . No matter how many times i tried it didn't work . Since the one plus store is very near my place i took the phone over there and they said the had to calibrate the sensor and after that i haven't faced any issue as such .Update after going to the store , still the issue persists technician came and verified the same and the replacements on the way . Hopefully won't face any issues with that one ."

 I got damaged product and i need this phone urgently but have to wait now"
"I was excited to get the One plus Nord2 5G phone in hand. I was a user of One plus one earlier and then moved to Redmi k20 Pro. and then again back to One+1 nord 2.But got disappointed with the performance of the new phone from oneplus.I used to get better battery backup and good camera interface in Redmi K20 pro even after 2 years of use.The oxygen OS getting mixed with color OS is pathetic. Lots of lag in applications.  Especially the one I got irritated is the Auto rotate option. I enabled Auto rotate for  watching you tube and all videos, but after a phone call , I noticed the dialer gets rotated but will not turn to normal screen even after keeping the phone straight , I have to restart the phone to get the dialer straight from rotated.Another issue noted is the camera focus, when we try to scan the bar code on whatsapp web, it takes time to capture or read the barcode , even when we try to take close shots pictures, i see the camera is not able to focus fast and stays blurred for a long time, then we have to adjust our self to get the clear picture.Over all the phone is light weight, and easy to handle. I did not feel heat up, unless i enabled hotspot for laptop connection. Being an earlier one plus user, I hope OnePlus come up with updates to solve these issue faced by users."
Phone hangs very often.Extremely poor sound qualityPoor camera qualityI had requested for replacement/return but not got any response from customer care. Even no one turned up for technical inspection. Shall never use OnePlus phone again.
"edited:- now I am from 2star to 1star because there is camera issue I facing if you use camera for 5-10 mins its automatically falls and closes Idk why all this issues are coming after 3rd update..😒please if you are purchasing the phone then understand there are a lot of phone available in the market which is better and chaper than this.eex. samsung A52,A72Mi 10i, poco f3gt, realme dont go for look"
I bought this as gift for my father!! Will share my First impressions.Pros:- In hand feel is premium felt like using samsung s series.- Display top notch for the price 👌 with 90hz.- Practically oneplus made good camera phone under this price point.- This is a perfect 5g phone has all bands.- still oxygen os is main layer and feels like oxygen os- build quality is strong.As hardware good device.Cons :- kinda oppofication code base destroys oneplus UI experience.- asks many kinda permissions while setting up device. Like for camera app asks call permissions. Unwanted permissions.Overall its good phone for the price. It's start phase of oppo-fication!!Please oneplus stay as oxygen os don't turn into something else. That's the key mvp of oneplus.
"Loved it, I am using the oneplus 8T I got this phone for my girlfriend and even though I spent like 13k extra when I got 8T I don't feel like the difference between both the phones are worth 13k. I am loving this phone.Pros:Fast chargingSmooth usageLooks (this depends user to user)CameraCons: Should have put the 120hz display instead of 90hzInclusion of colorOS UI in camera and settings"

 So many bugs and issues , and apps closing automatically after using less than 30 seconds."
"I had received a dummy product.I am really disappointed to say this, it was first time I came across such an experience, disheartened....Amazon and One plus😠😠"
"Phone is heating like hell always at 38°c ,not so worth it according to the hype they created .heats up to 44°c you can not touch the phone. heating is its major problem"
"Disappointed since the day 1, all the app says storage not found...the camera switches off all the time, cannot download images on what'sapp even after giving all the permissions..It took me around 10 attempts to attach the picture in this review evertime while attaching the file app crashes...Going for a replacement if it doesn't resolve in one or two day..."
"Don't buy this product. It has some serious issues with IMEI number. Any OnePlus system may not recognize the IMEI code for the mobile and then your mobile will be ghost for OnePlus. In this case, you will not be eligible for warranty. This has happened with me and now OnePlus team is extremely lethargic and least interested in addressing this issue."
"I received this phone yesterday and I'm really disappointed with pathetic camera as it can not capture good pics with close shorts & mostly this phone camera provides over contrast images in daylights and doesn't provide decent image in night mode & battery drains fast. Only thing you can be happy about this phone is battery charges very fast with 100% in just 33 minutes. I feel like cheated with this product purchase and if Amazon is checking on reviews. Please take back this phone & refund the amount or provide a better replacement in the same price range.Update 15/08 - Overall performance is ok now, however in close shots rear camera struggles.Update 27/08 - I still feel it's not worth buying. And for those who want to buy new handset in this price range should wait for Pixel 5a release in India."
Color of product is dark than the  color shown in description. After one day of delivery when I asked to return or replace the item they bluntly refused this.  Worst experience with One Plus . I have given one star because there was no option below this. Totally unhappy and unsatisfied!
Performance is really good.Camera and features are better than previous Nord.
"Pros:1) Charging Power2) Processor3) Camera features4) Stereo Speakers5) Display6) Storage with UFS 3.17) NFC8) Gorilla glass 5 front and backCons:1) Display size2) USB 2.0 not able to stream gaming.3) Dolby Atoms4) Google dailer, contacts and messaging5) Plastic frame edges"
"Mobile not switching on . showing error like "" the serial is not match fastbook_unlock_verify ok"". Parhetic.....what kind of quality checking is being carried out by ONEPLUS"
"Worst phone from Oneplus.Now Oneplus oxygen os Feel Oppo color os & Some Camera Feature are also same as Color OsI suggest you not to buy because it's not feel oneplus Flagship phone it's feel ordinary phone now just like oppo realme.If you are a fan of oneplus then definitely buy this phone without any thinking but you are A new user of oneplus & you are not a oneplus fan then go for other phone at this price range like Oppo Reno 6 , Realme x7 Max, Mi 11x etc.Thank you 🙏"

 today phone has blasted"
"Thankyou team Oneplus and Amazon for ruining my 2years of pocket money saving s and giving me this Heater Im happy Now I have it, I'm warming food and tea most of the time with it,So frustrating thing is Heating issues and battery drain with this phone other issues I can handle it.I ordered first handset but it has display issues and order replacement and I got it.OnePlus brand is known for a quality product few years back I don't know why they are playing with there own reputation.Otherwise its a good phone, except you if you can ok with heating issues."
Over heating mble with in secns
Phone has lot of over heating problems . When external climate is high in summer camera shutdowns automatically and phone switches off . While charging phone heats up . Observed in lot of scenarios . Need a proper investigation after spending alot of money for better product you cannot expect these kind of issues .better or for good avoid buying OnePlus products
"First Impressions-will update detailed reviewThe phone is solid, feels good in hand, small size, can be used single handedly, the back glass does not attract fingerprint. I have the haze blue variant. It's a glossy finish. Some YouTubers say that the gray has a matt finish, so you can checkDisplay: Display is crisp. The brightness levels are good for indoor and outdoor usage. Doesn't get as bright as OnePlus 9 series, but decent enough. There is little blue tint that you notice when you tilt the screen Don't know if it's common.Speakers: Speakers are decently loud. I thought it would be low, but I liked the sound output. Call quality is also decent. During calls , No issues in hearing the other person, earpiece are also decently loud. I won't say it's the most clear I have heard. Overall you won't ve disappointed with the sound output, it can go decently loud.Software: Oxygen OS is smooth, doesn't come with a lot of bloatware, although u may have to be cautious of some permissions like that in search bar and there are some built in Oxygen OS Apps. Can be easliy avoided. There are a few bugs, like the vibration motor intensity change is not working well on my phone. I will report the same in the communityCamera: Main camera is really good. can take night shots as well with adequate details. Performs really well indoors and outdoor. Wide angle camera is below average. The details are not good. It can only be used to put some pics on social media. I am considering it a single camera device. So a better deal compared to Pixel 4a (because 4a has become an year old). 2 mp mono camera- I doubt if it even worksCharging- Battery life is decent, can easliy last one full day. Charging speeds are good, if the atmosphere is cool. I tested the 65W charger, charges the phone fully in around 45 mins, although I am not going to use it daily, because fast charging takes a toll on the battery life. So charging with a 20W charger, even with that charges decently fast.Performance: Haven't done gaming yet, will update the review after that. But general performance is very good. No glitches, apps are wroking pretty smoothly. Doesn't heat up in normal usage.Update after 15 days of use-Initially the battery drains fast, but it's normal for a new phone. Post 3-4 complete recharge cycles, the battery is now performing as per expectations.The main camera quality is really good, can even take some really crisp night light photos. Gaming performance is smooth for casual gamers. The phone doesn't get heat up that much. It remains within limits. Definitely not a full fledged gaming phone.The software experience is very good, that's something which lacks in a lot of android phones. The UI and transitions are very smooth, no visible lags, and the best part is it's single hand usability. Overall it's a great phone for power users and professionals. Definitely not the most feature rich or on-paper powerful, but it ticks most of the boxes.AFTER 3 MONTHSA lot of bugs.....screecast and bluetooth doesn't work well"
It's worst

 My first one plus here is my opinion after using this phone more than 1 month.Look -10/10Display- 10/10Camera - 10/9Battery - 10/10Charging- 10/10Finger print- 10/10Overall- 10/9.5Superb just go for it."
"Earlier I put my negative review here, after buying the second Nord5, but they didn’t publish it. I think they publish only positive reviews plus very few negative reviews so as to get rating above 4. The battery drains too fast, phone heats occasionally. Be cautious before buying.  Nord2 exploded few times in India."
Recently bought it. Build quality is not too satisfying but a good phone cover should be fine.Pros :1. OIS in such a low price2. Mediatek Dimensity 1200Cons :1. Plastic body2. Wide angle camera's low light performance not satisfactory3. 4500mah is a low Battery capacity. Would have not increased the production cost much for a 5500+ mah battery
"I bought this phone as an all-rounder to stream multimedia and play games but now I regret the decision as this device is unable to stream HD content on prime video despite having WivevineL1 certification, HDR playback on Netflix is also not supported as you can see from the attached screenshot.OnePlus customer care is pretty useless as they said they're unaware of this issue. This could be a device specific problem.Also the phone case I recieved was slightly deformed, this is definitely not the experience you would expect when you spend around 30K for a smartphone."
Initially I got defective piece but eventually it was replaced by Amazon.Hence rewriting the review again.1. Design 5/52. Performance 5/53. Battery life 5/54. Camera 4/5(front camera needs bit improvement. Rear camera is superb)5. Connectivity 5/56. Video playback 4/57. Audio playback 6/5(the best)

 One Plus Nord 2 5G की Quality खराब है और amazon की सेवाएं इससे भी ज्यादा घटिया है। मैँने 08-11-21को फ़ोन ख़रीदा था। mobile में  IMEI नंबर नहीं होने के कारण फ़ोन start नही हुआ जिसकी पुष्टि amazon के Techanical visit के द्वारा करवाई गई, मुझे replacmemet में नया फ़ोन भेजा गया परन्तु amazon के dilevery boy ने मोबाइल रिप्लेसमेन्ट देने से मना कर दिया और कहा कि मैं आपको फ़ोन नही दे सकता कियूकि आपके फ़ोन में IMEI नंबर है और वो फ़ोन replace नही किया। उसके बाद amazon से मेरा return create किया फिर amazon का डिलीवरी boy आया फिर उसने return नहीं लिया और कहा कि आपके इस फ़ोन में IMEI नही है इस लिए में returen नहीं ले सकता, इस तरह आज दिन तक यही चल रहा है ना तो मेरा मोबाइल replace हूया और ना ही रिफंड amount if Rs. 29999."
"Launched at 12AM, ordered at 12:03AM :PThis is my primary and only phone now, and after two days of usage, well...- Body: Feels good. Really. They have perfected the edges and feels solid to hold, does not feel flimsy, if only they reduced the camera bump a little.- Screen: The 90Hz AMOLED is love at first sight. <3The colour reproduction, the viewing angles, the scrolls, they are just amazing.- Battery: Lasts me more than a day, and charging is a breeze, takes less around 20 minutes to reach from 10% to 100%. Does get a little warm with continuous screen time, but not worrisome standards.- UI: The haptics and the tiny animations they put in are extremely thought out, like a tiny circling dot around the front camera when in use, and ability to change the fingerprint animations, etc. My first OnePlus, don't judge me if these are new to me.- This is my first in-display fingerprint phone, and I am not sure if its just mine, or in general, but coming from a solid physical fingerprint scanner, I feel this scanner misses a few hits, you really need to know the exact area, etc. Not a deal breaker. The animations and haptics compensate.- Camera: High hopes. Normal daylight shots are fine, but ""ultra-wide"" is disappointing. Night ultra wide goes haywire. Portraits are okay, good skin tones, but bokeh feels out of place. Heavy image processing, feels artificial. The camera UI isn't ergonomic and feels out of place for OnePlus. No Macro.- Software: Day 2 and software update for Oxygen OS.- No Memory card, lack of expandable storage :x- No headphone jack :(Let's see what happens.12 days after:Received two OTA updates, not much camera changes as company claims, but Wifi connection becomes seamless.Camera: My my still so weird.4k 60fps N/A. ""Ultra crisp portraits"" becomes inactive in 'portrait' mode, only works in regular photo mode. 50mp inactive for Night mode. Front camera still average, they desperately add extra white. HDR looks too artificial. 'Move further away' keeps popping up on portrait, even though subject is more than an arm's length, and the bokeh messes up. *All that can be fixed with an update*Video: Supports 2160p on Youtube, but no HDR compatibility on Netflix, Prime.Battery: I am a regular user, and I am still left with 40 - 45% battery after a day. And charging this is such a bliss, max 15 - 20 minutes and voila 100%."
Display issue received defective product not expected from OnePlus display colour changes and screen goes black
"Apps like YouTube, whatsapp, Flipkart keep crashing, sounds glitches, Video freezes, SD card error while opening the camera (LOL it does not have a SD card slot). No HD streaming in Amazon Prime Videos and Hotstar even after Widevine L1 Support.Amazon, gimme my money back,Update- Amazon has accepted my refund request. Thanks Amazon."
This phone feels good in the hand. Specs-wise it's a killer as top-notch processer 8GB ram cameras are also good.But the issue is the processer as it is not fully optimized. I am getting slow performance as of now.Overall Recommended but only to the One Plus users. If you are trying OnePlus phones for the first time then I am not recommending you.
"After 2 weeks of use here is my review.Pros:1. Look & feel.2. Rear camera & photo quality.3. Fast charging. 100%🔋 in 30mins.4. Fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Worst battery life.2. 5 hrs screen on time only.I've used only one 4G sim. If I've used both sim slots guess the battery backup. Oh sorry this is 5G smartphone. Wait for 1-2 hour screen on time when 5G come.My 3.5 years old mobile Realme 1 (3410 mAh) has batter 🔋 life than this so called flagship oh sorry Oppo smartphone  with ColorOS😅.If you are not after brand, then go for Poco F3 GT. For same or less amount it'll give superior performance in every segment compare to OnePlus Nord 2."
Major Touch issue is there so - 0 pointsMajor Heating issue so  - 0 pointsBattery life - 5/10Camera - 3/10Sound quality - 8/10Screen - 6/10Charging time - 10/10Do not waste your money for this phone. This is a total waste.

 It's been a day I am using it based on that below is my viewPros :1. 65w charging2. Oxygen OS - still the smoothest os3. Performance - No issues in daily tasks4. Camera performance is good overall.5. OnePlus's brand value.Cons :1. Battery backup is not good. I have to charge twice a day. 5 6 hours SOT only2. Ulta wide camera - As soon as you crop into photo there's noise3. Gaming - It's a flashship processor but still can not game in high graphics + 60fps. My old SD855 phone does better job.This processor requires optimisation!Overall a good purchase. 😄"
"The phone is definitely underclocked, you need to enable high-performance mode to get the flagship experience. because on normal mode, the performance is close to Snapdragon855, in the high-performance mode, it's close to SD870 also it heats up quickly in this mode.- For some weird reason, the motion and gesters option asks for call history and manage calls permissions- UI is uneven in many areas- The Camera application, battery page, Display settings page, Storage page are straight from Color OS- Main cam is pretty good in low light as well- UW is soft and almost unusable in indoor/low light conditions- Display doesn't get brighter, as compared to competition- After the first boot- The photo auto-updated itself,*Without user permission*  that too written in  chineese language- 65W Charging is superfast- Very good haptics- Good set of speakers- 90hz is constant throughout the UI- Very good main and front cameras- Feels lightweight and doesn't feel big/ uncomfortable in hand"

"I got my One plus Nord 2 on 26th, as usual Amazon fast delivery, abt phone it’s pretty good decent for price range, playing all high end game with out an issue. Camera is good, photos are good and day light it’s excellent. Battery back good for one full day , 65w charge so no worry on battery backup."
I bought OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone after using it for around 5 hours . I kept it idle for 2 hours And now when I am trying to use it YouTube is getting forced closed after every 5-10min Gallery is also closing Camera is automatic shut down and WhatsApp videos are unable to play MX player stopped working.
"It seems that OnePlus has lost mind..1. Camera Quality:  it's the super worst in all the cases, specially front and ultra wide cameras are most worst performer.. front seems to be 5mp instead of 32mp.. super disappointment.. main shooter is also performing just ok.. main 50mp is capable to perform more but OnePlus algorithms mess up here..2. Performance: Diamensity 1200 is more capable but OnePlus again lowered the performance by using their extra idiot mindset...3. Screen Quality: it's just ok, not that much superb.. 600 nits max brightness with average chin size.. common OnePlus it's 2021..4. Battery Life: battery performance is also just ok but I think after the updates this issue will be resolved (Hope so).. charging speed is mind blowing..5. Rest all things are good as considered the price.. 30k tag.. if you consider 35k high storage nord 2 then it's seriously not worth it in any case..6. Software Experience: I will say it's completely color OS under the OnePlus skin.. No good experience with this twin UI.. shame shame OnePlus..Note: I am using OnePlus 7T from more than 22 months and it's really good in all the aspects."
"I have been using the OnePlus Nord 2 for about 5 days. Let me assure you this is the review of a regular 'user' of phone and not by a reviewer!1. The Nord 2 looks premium. If you want to flaunt the colour of blue haze variant, you shouldn't use the back cover which covers it's looks! But if you are particular about smudges and scratches better put on the cover. It also has a (plastic) screen cover pre-applied.2. The amoled screen is bright and has a decent visibility in daylight. The punch hole can be a disturbance if you are switching from a notch screen.3. The software (oxygen os 11.3) is clean, less spammy but has a number of issues. For e.g the app cloner isn't recognising apps to clone and if you are using two accounts of whatsapp, telegram etc, you are stuck. Hopefully the software is updated with corrections.4. The sms app takes quite a while (sometimes irritatingly long time) to match the contact input from the address book.5. Apps load faster than other custom o.s.6. Battery lasted one full day with 90Hz display with routine daily usage of multiple apps (no videos or games).7. Charged from 20 to 80 in approximately 15 minutes. There is heating with charging but not much with non-game usage.8. There is a set of stereo speakers with a fair quality sound - not great.9. Camera is pretty good both in daylight and in dark.10. There is Corning gorilla glass both in front and back which is good but the frame is of plastic which could be a dampener. Also, there is no 3.5 mm jack.Overall, OnePlus Nord 2 is good value for money phone if you are upgrading from midrange and not yet wanting to go for 'flagships'. The phone has a good 5g processor, clean o.s, promised software support and brand value.Update as on 25th September 2021Till now, the OS isn't supporting dual apps except WhatsApp and telegram. My enquires to the technical team yileds only vague and uncertain replies. This is is indeed a deal breaker for those who use multiple cloned apps. I am not certain if OnePlus is even aware of this issue in their phone"
Phone is not working properly after 30days. My phone stopped working. Don't waste your money. Oneplus is now making people fool. Seriously 1month it was working fine. But now there is lot of bugs. My phone switch off automatically and not turning on. I visited service center. They told me there is technical issue so i have to wait for 8-10days to fix  problem. I just wasted my 30k for this cheap phone with branding of one plus. I feel cheated and very very disappointed.
"Not satisfied with the phone, heating issues, hanging. Tried replacing the phone but same issues with that piece also. So returned the phone. It has been almost 20 days, I am waiting for refund, customer care does not care. Every time they say the refund will be done in 3 to 5 days. And I wait and call them again and again. Very very very bad from Amazon and I am a dissatisfied customer. Will never buy any mobile from Amazon."
Basic features like Call Recording is not thereGoogle Dialler is installed as default app for making and receiving calls and it does not let you automatic call recordingIf call record option is pressed it will tell the other person on the phone that your call is being recordedDefault one plus dialler is not available in this phoneYou cannot install default one plus dialler or any third party call recording app
dislike plz don't buying this phone heating issues.  ye itna heat ho rha h ki blast v kr sakta  h agar brand me dam h to replace kr de home delivery iska service center v har jagah nhi h
First time I choose one plus but finally disappointed.The phone battery drains very fast....and front camera not up to mark...better to choose other phone ...don't believe on other rating.... worst videos will execute during night time.Now heating issue started after one week of buying nord2.dont waste your money ..after purchase u feel regret like me
"phone is overheating in normal use, phone camera is good, but i am scared to use this phone because of overheating, it might blast,I used Honor and Huawei phones before this, and never faced any overheating problem ever in those phones, One plus will come and check , but I want refund for this product, life threatening products must not be at home"
"The so called overhyped Oxygen OS is full of bugs,Battery drains quickly.App clone function is not workingNo default call recording facility.No default music player.No default video player.Cameras are average.Annoying blue dots on third party apps which can't be removed.when you try to download apps for music and videos the phone shows shortage of memory. I have used just 27GB from 128GB and the phone asks me to uninstall the third party apps.Utterly disappointed"
"The phone is quite good and practical and only area oppofication is clearly felt is OnePlus is yet to enable audio enhancement for tws/Bluetooth.My OnePlus Bluetooth earphones & tws sounds awesome when used with OnePlus 6,but when connected to Nord 2 they sound flat lacks Bass as there is no Audio tuner enabled for Bluetooth earphones.OnePlus want to show the difference between Nord and OnePlus series phones and is clearly felt but playing with Audio settings is not a good idea.My old phone OnePlus 6 has some stunning features in UI than Nord 2, so rating 3.Will update to 4 when Audio tuner is enabled and 5 star if UI is good in future updates. attached screenshot too."
"Lookwise it's just awesome one, single hand supported size phone, if anyone need mobile for normal uses like call,chat & lil bit entertainment With simple android interface then it's performance is good enough fast & smooth plus camera quality is also very good at this price point which I liked very much. Wrap charge works fast but battery drains fast too while gaming n doing some heavy task. Its not good for gamers even it handle games good enough I don't recommend this phone coz of small display,low refresh rate, lack of 3.5 mm jack which makes trouble while Playing games like cod, pubg etc, phone also gets heat and you won't be able to play long enough.i switched from poco X2 in which I usually get low fps & graphic settings but still it was comfortable & good device to play these games. Overall Overhyped product & I miss 3.5 mm jack the most😭. One more thing currently Amazon prime, Netflix & other ott platform not streaming in HD in my device even I hv tried all settings n discussed with tech support."
Sir from your side not clear these phones are sefty for used we read newspaper nord2 5g blast problem ... check pl... take action..
Expected this phone to be superior to 6T.Camera quality is pathetic.Charging slower than 6T.It was a mistake to buy this phone.
"With lots of expectations I had purchased this phone but it turned out to be a big regret. Let me quickly highlight some pros and cons as per my observations : Pros :1. Phone is slim and light in weight.2. Charging speed is good enough.3. Quality of speaker is above average.Cons:1. First impression itself was bad because right after the initial set up, phone restarted and Chinese script appeared (picture of it is being uploaded for ref). Security for this phone is doubtful.2. I'm not a gamer or a heavy user, I just wanted a good camera phone. So considering the brand name OnePlus, I had mainly purchased this phone for camera but this phone's picture quality is not satisfactory at all. Rear camera is somehow ok (average) but the front camera is really bad. Infact my Poco M2pro's cam is much better (pictures from outdoor uploaded)3. Battery drains quite fast, doubtful about 4500 mah battery quality.4. No privacy in call recording, as soon as call recording starts it is being notified to the other person also.4. Brightness is very low especially in outdoors.This phone has much more cons than pros. At this price range we can get a much better premium phone. Now I'm regretting so much that I should have gone for Google pixel 4a or Iqoo 7 or Samsung A52."
Writing review after 2 day of use.. What if I bought this for Google purpose. This phone does the same.. I don't know why everything is linked with Google. From phone dialer to messages. Why can't be just OnePlus.. and 35k for all this. Totally fed-up and disappointed with OnePlus.Best part you can't uninstall or disable any app like this.. you do force stop them but after some time they will restart automatically and you will never know.. Seems to me I have wasted my 35k on this.. suggesting others to must see the phone once by yourself before you buy it.. may be I will be able to save your money..  it's my only opinion...lastlyPhone name must be Google Nord 🤣🤣 not the Nord 2 from OnePlus
"This is the second time I am putting review and they just ignored as fake, I will post until, I get proper reply from them, or I should go for consumer court, for not satisfying my issue,#amzon.in have mailed me that it's fake and fraud review, #amzon is doing fraud one me.I will come what issue I am facing.1) Network issue, for every 5-10 minutes the network will go, if m in call it will disconnect or playing online games you know right what will be my situation2) #OnePlus have mentioned gorilla glass 5, my mobile fallen from a less than a feet, it got broken I have no idea is they scamming us, while giving cheap quality3) Really they are loosing the genuine customer, and the mobile is only 5 months old, I already submitted network issue in service center, and they were telling about we should update software, i didn't bought the phone for do software updates in service center in less than 5 months ,😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡#oneplus"

 Great phone under 30k!!! Consider it if you want a value for money phone that meets all expectations! That feeling owning a oneplus is anyday better than owning an iqoo vivo oppo poco!! Oxygen os apparently has some funtouch os touches but trust me oxygen os still is alive which itself is a reason why I went for this device!!! Kudos to oneplus"
"Hi, i am sharing my experience and few photos after using this Nord 2 Grey Sierra 8GB for almost a month now.1) Looks are premium and same with the Oxygen OS experience. Feels very handy  while picking but anyway i have put a hardcase for extra safety.2) Camera quality is excellent and adds beauty to my insta page. The rear camera fascinates with no matter of time, day or night. The ultra night mode is magical to fill light in the photo even in extra dark conditions. But absence of dedicated macro camera is a big let down. Front camera performs well in normal and portrait mode  but in video calls of whataspp a white hazy effect is being experienced and we can experience that camera quality is low. Not sure its the OS or the whatsapp tech issue with Nord 2 device. Facing slight HDR issues in rear camera also but it auto adjust on touch focus.3) Battery charging is really cool. Fully charge under 35 minutes and i usually charge when its around 20% and it take hardly 20-25 min to reach 100. But battery draining is also noticed evidently when no apps are running. Its really a big issue and hoping it to get rectified in future firmware updates. Coz of that on normal usage it can last for only a day with approx Screen ON Time of 4-5 Hours only.4) Havent faced any bugs so far as i got 2 firmware updates right after unboxing.5) Phone gets slightly warm while playing games and the temperature is around 40-42 deg. But havent gone beyond that. Iam not a hardcore gamer on phone and hence i feel the heating issue can be different for gamers.6) Overall for the money spend, really feels that its worthy and hoping that battery drain issue will be rectified soon."

 After update the device is not going to Start and instantly I reported it to Amazon and request a return. But till now it’s about 15 days gone but they are not going to pick up.#DepressedNo one is listening to my problem."
"This review is going to be a bit long, since I'm writing this review after almost a month of extensive usage.Ordered it on the first day the product was made available. As expected, got it delivered in 2 days, thumbs up for that. Was using a Huawei Honor Play previously. Got 3 OTA updates during this period.Build quality:Good enough build quality, has Gorilla glass 5 on the front and back but the frame is made up of plastic, not a dealbreaker I'd say. The buttons are nice and clicky, it has the iconic alert slider in it, works well too.Display:Coming from a phone having IPS panel, I loved the display on this one. That being said, it could've been a bit more brighter since the legibility under direct sunlight is not that great. Watching movies/video on this One has been nothing but excellent. HDR support on Netflix is still missing though, however it hardly matters for me.In-display Fingreprint Sensor:Works fine 95% of the time. However there have been ocassions when the fingerprint icon does not show up on homescreen.Software:Ad-free bloatware-free clean UI. AOD works well. The OTA updates I got were bug free. Nothing like Realme or Redmi.Speaker and haptics:The sterio speakers are outstanding, even at high volumes you wouldn't feel any distortion. Haptics are good enough too.Camera:The 50MP primery camera blew me away. The images turned out to be top notch even at low light conditions. The 8MP ultrawide camera is kind of okay-ish, they could've given a 12MP sensor instead of the useless monochrome 2Mp sensor. The front facing 32Mp camera does a good job in decent lighting conditions but the HDR algorithm on this One tends to blow out details in brightly lit conditions..Battery and Charging:I'm a person who always keep the internet turned ON. Either wifi or mobile data when I'ma away from home. I was easily getting screen on time of 6-7.5hrs on wifi and 5-6hrs on mobile data. Btw utilizing both the sim slots(Airtel and Jio).The charging time is just crazy. 10% to a 100% in less than 25 minutes using the 65W charger included in the box. OMG.Call Quality and Network Reception:Excellent. Took long calls(>30 minutes) using the earpiece, wasn't getting hot.Performance and Gaming:Excellent performamce. Did not feel any lagginess or stutter. Scrolling through instagram feeds was super smooth, thanks to the 90Hz refresh rate.Played BGMI as well as Genshin impact with ease at Smooth+ 60fps and Medium+30 fps setting respectively. Was getting around 50-52fps thoughout on BGMI and 24-27fps on Genshin impact. The phone became a bit hot after playing Genshin Impact after 30 minutes which is not surprising.Got the 8/128 varient for Rs.28,250 after 1750 discount for HDFC Bank Debit Card No Cost 6 month EMI.Display: 7/10Call Quality: 9/10Camera(Rear): 8/10Camera(selfie): 7/10Battery: 8/10Speakers and haptics: 8/10Performace and Gaming: 8/10Value for money: 9/10Hope you guys found the review useful."
Ordered the phone soon after the launch in Amazon on 26th midnight.. was waiting for the launch for a month.Totally excited after a super fast delivery.Extra excited on opening the package.The phone is super smooth and sleek as expected. In total love with it 😍😍Have been recommending to my friends since I opened the package 😃#oneplusnord2 ❤️
"Bought this phone a couple of days back for my daughter and she is happy with it except one major problem which is:1. Jio sim is not working. The SIM gets detected, signal tower bars are 90% but whenever she tries to call through JIO the option to select the Jio SIM is shown disabled. Incidentally, the JIO is in second sim slot. There is also no VoLTE setting option in the menu. Only voice over WIFI is present in settings menu and works for the other SIM.Oneplus should immediately come with some solution for this, pending which the Jio users may not be able to use this phone in all likelihood.Edit: After tinkering with settings I could enable Volte in my JIO SIM (2nd slot) and now its working. Although I can't clearly explain what was the change I did which triggered the Volte. It suddenly became enabled whem I was playing with different menus in DUAL SIM settings.Increased a Star feom 3 to 4."
I used to earlier use a Realme XT and exchanged it for this in hope for a better and premium phone but this phone makes me regret changing it. It feels like a downgrade even though this phone costed twice as much.Looking at the reviews it almost seems like there are different versions of this one phone. Many have faced numerous issues and in my case it was no different.•Front camera is working like a 5MP camera with no in-depth colours or clarity.•Back camera is very good.•Battery doesn't last for an entire day(8 hours) even with normal usage.•There are prominent heating issues. The phone heats up under normal usage.•The display doesn't looks good.•Speaker is actually quite good.•Charging speed is excellent but the drainage nullifies it's positive.The merging of Oxygen OS with that of Realme & Oppo OS has been a disaster. Too many bugs and issues with the phone. Doesn't feel like a OnePlus phone really. The software update too hasn't solved any problems. I just hope they get it right with the future updates.I've been really disappointed with this phone and will be going for a replacement and will update the review if/when i get one.Would really suggest others to not buy this phone currently.
"1. Many apps are getting crashed within seconds of launch.2. Showing storage full whereas the brand new phone has entire storage available.3. App cloner not working properly. Not allowing to import the back up.All such issues should be fixed immediately. Many people are facing same issues. But even after 4-5 days of launch, OnePlus developers are not able to solve the bugs.To add, camera quality is also not that good.Not sure which new issue will crop up going forward."
"I purchased this phone with high expectation. After somedays of use my charger have issue. So i send my charger to the service centre. And after making so many followups and requesting calls finally i got my charger after 27days.It really make me feel sick. Everyday i chat with oneplus with whatsapp chat. They gave so many falls promises like they will follow up the issue and contact me within 24 to 48hours.but i never get that followup message from them. Then i got my service centre number in google(oneplus won't have their service centre numbers)and contact them personally. They said charger is replaced but due to man power problem they are not courier the charger. Which is completely nonsense. And after 1week they courier the charger. But now I'm facing onother new problem the adopter is heating while charging the phone. Again i contact oneplus. They simply said that they can't fix it.and said to contact the service centre. They again diagnos the charger and give a solution to it. But service centee is far away from me. So i couried the charger and they take nearly 30days to reach me back. Now the oneplus saying that contacting service centre is the only option they won't providing new charger and giving me more work to solve my problem. I don't understand what is the use of waiting 30days and contacting oneplus. I don't know what to do know. And who will be the responsible if any damge occur in future. And phone also get heated after some time of normal use. Camer also not focus subject so many time. Totally not worth for money. And if you face any problem after the sale, you will get a horrible service. So better not buy this phone. Not worth for money n Your life become misserable. If i have minus point I'll give it to them only because of such horrible after sale service. And you have to wait 2 hours to get them in chat. And they won't consider your feedback and won't take any action against it. buy some better mobile to make your life easy."
"Purchased this mobile on the day of Launch. Loved the phone, Great Packing and prompt delivery by Amazon as usual.Pros: - Great battery back up. For my typical day time use, the battery last for a day easily.-  Great camera for both indoor, outdoor as well as Night mode is awesome! Close to a flagship phone.- 90Hz screen is butter smooth. Its not 120hz but better than most phones in this range. Screen is bright and color representation is good.Cons/My dislikes:- No Expandable memory slot. If you are using cloud services, you should be fine but disappointed.- No Headphone jack. I knew it before I bought it but still, I feel like it could have been left alone. :)"
1) Front camera quality like 5mp .indoor & outdoor camera ok ..  potrate mode white balance is not good 2) 10-100% charges in 22min but battery drains fast3) facing heat issue while normal use...4) Display & performance is goodmy 3yr old OnePlus 6T with 16MP camera captures images much better than this mobile...  I'm really disappointed with this phone. previously I have OnePlus 6t & 7T pro so I ordered blindly OnePlus make me fool
Software issues coming . Apps are getting closed autlmatically and also having some heating issues. Front camera giving results as of some cheap mobiles.I have applied for a replacement lets check after it gets replaced.

 So got this new phone on 8th Feb 2022 and on 10th Feb 2022 the screen turned green for sometime. Raised a replacement request but they said phone is fine as the issue is not happeng again. GREAT! According to them phone is in one year warranty and you can get it fixed anytime.So I wasted 30K on a phone only to give to service center with in two days of purchase.Phone screen turned green again on 13th Feb 2022, but this time I took pictures and a video.  Hopefully now they will take this crappy phone back.A BIG NO TO THIS PHONE. I should have bought something for 15k, it gives the same performance. Please think before investing 30k on this phone.PS: if you would taken the phone back on first time, I would have not given such revie"
"Received OnePlus Nord 2 (256GB/ Hazel Blue) on 27th July.I've been a loyal user of OnePlus devices, and they have never disappointed me.Carrying forward the legacy, I had a lot of expectations from OnePlus Nord 2. But OnePlus failed me this time.The moment I started the device, I faced heating issue. Camera is average. Images are blurred even at 2x zoom. I've asked for a replacement.Just a caution to future OP customers, it's no more the same OP that it used to be few years back. It's truly a Chinese product now.All Marketing, no quality."
"Dont buy this product, there is display issue, apps crashing automatically while you are working on it, heating issue and so on. PATHETIC"
Just received the mobile and while doing the initial setup phone is becoming hot especially back side part. Not sure if it's a real issue  one should consider while buying. Also no hands free Alexa operation which they mentioned in nord and not sure how far it's working in that model.
"In this budget OnePlus nailed the specs. Performance is fast, battery lasts more than a day and half. Camera quality is pretty good (again for the budget). I'm facing software issues but I do believe they'll be ironed out later as this is the first iteration of oxygen+color OS.EDIT: Changing the rating from 5 to 3 stars because of the terrible software. It was released completely uncooked. Night mode in camera always takes really blurry photos, what was the point of incorporating OIS? Keyboard location and mistouch prevention doesn't work. You can't delete pre-installed Google apps. OnePlus' messages and caller apps were better. For some reason, at times the phone says the SIM's roaming has activated but in reality it isn't. It's still toggled off in the settings. There are many more such bugs and I was waiting for updates from OnePlus to fix them, but the recent update hasn't changed anything."
"I gifted this mobile to my Jiju on his birthday. I have listed out all pros and cons of this mobile phone after using it for one day.Pros:--1) Design & Look - Premium look. Use of glass back increases the premium appeal.2) Build Quality - Build quality looks good. But i have not performed drop test ;), so can't say much about it.3) Performance - AI (Artificial intelligence) enabled chip-set handles multitasking and heavy-graphic games without any hassle.  - Scrolling is very smooth due to 90Hz refresh rate.4) Display - AMOLED display is awesome.5) Camera - AI (Artificial intelligence) enhances color reproduction + Sony lenses offers accurate details + Optical image stabilization avoids blur pictures / videos due to shakiness. a) Photo - Daylight pictures are amazing.  - Low light pictures are average.  - Front Camera takes very good selfie pictures. b) Video -  Videos are also very good.6) Battery - Good battery backup. ~30 mins from 0% to 100% due to wrap charge 65w fast charging.7) 5G support - Not tested yet because 5G is not rolled out in India yet.Cons:--1) Battery - Slight heating issue while charging or playing heavy games.2) No headphone jack. So can't use wired earphone / headset.3) Value for money - 1+ Nord 2 is little overpriced until you use bank offer (1000 Rs. discount).Also they came up with 3 color variants but surprisingly they didn't release the green woods color variant which looks amazing. Hence deducting one point for both.Guys, Please let me know if this information is helpful for you then ill keep updating my review if my experience changes with usage."
"I have written this review after using the phone for about a month now.Earlier i was using an iphone & Oppo F11 pro so the comparision is a mix of both.As a first time user of One plus, i did not find any significant difference in the Oxygen OS which looks to me pretty hyped.In fact it is very much similar to Color OS in Oppo, and a privacy vault missing from it.. so not really a big fan.On the other side to make it single button iphone kind of feel, it is not that good in handling. Which just leaves it in somewhere in between.Camera is great, night mode specifically.You get an option to use both front and rear cam at the same time..which is new for me.Pictures are good.Processing speed is good, did not feel any lag in anywhere with games or multitasking.Display is great, colors and temperature are better then oppo but not better than iphone.A technical information, if you are using snapchat/similar apps and cannot see video of the other person then check your display settings and close the video image enhancer option.Charges quickly in about 35 min to full battery, but i also feel it drains at a rapid pace too. I am a constant user of phone so will be better for people with normal usage.One good thing is that phone is slightly less in width then oppo F11 or similar phones ...which allows you to have a better grip.Lack of 3.5 mm earphone jack is the bew industry trend, so getting acquinted to it. Tge bluetooth pairing is quick and good.The look and feel of the phone is good, kind of semi-premium phone.Stereo sound of the speakers is ok.As a takeaway i was looking for something exceptional in One plus as per the feedbacks and hype in the circle (benchmarking it across Oppo) so that ways nothing extraordinary.May be before integration of Oppo and One plus the original Oxygen OS would have been better but i dont have any experience of that.For those who dont know, Oppo is the manufacturer of One plus phones in India.Judging it by as a smartphone, it is good and worth buying given the specifications that it has."

HiDon't even expect from one plus. This is really redicolous. First charged full and kept aside and while battery got drained out without any use in night in just 4 hours.Phone is getting heated only when we open it and I don't even use it then only it is heating.I think there is some issue in this brand. Never get such a complain about one plus.I purchased One plus 8 also but this time I am not happy with one plus.There is some issue with this brand. Need to look into this.I want to return the phone.
"Great, sinply awesome in every aspect, great camera, display, charging, speakers everything.Great pricing too.A worthy upgrade from nord 1."
"Day one : Instant regretIs there anything to like about this phone?I don't know if I've been scammed or oneplus has deteriorated. The only reason I bought this phone was camera.I had Poco F1 (adware and bloatware cleared) and Nord 2 stands no where close to F1. I went thru a series of traumatic episodes while clicking thru the camera modes and it's results. Immediately I applied for return but there poped up several clauses for item brought thru exchange. Now I have no option but to sit and cry for the wrong decision I made. And yes!! this phone plugged in for charging can evaporated my tear drops as well. Play heavy games and  turn this phone into heater.Things I like on this phone:Smooth scrolling.Oxygen OS is clean though its no longer the pure Oxygen OS.Phone case included.Overall: Don't buy, not kiddingEdit: An explode incident is circulating in social media. This phone heats up dangerously. I wish I could get a refund.Phone freezed and the wallpaper disappeared. Display often gets filled with noisy pixels."
"I was waiting to buy this phone in first sale bcoz of the hype over its features and finally got it. And im really surprised why people are crazy abt oneplus phones. The O.S is not tht great and not so user friendly. the basic things like1) Dialer app - there is no full screen image coming for incoming callers. if u want to search for a contact  U need to scroll down to go to specific alphabet  or u need to search in search bar.There is no side bar with alphabets given  where u can directly jump to the specific alphabet in contacts app.2) messages - im unable to find whether the message came from sim 1 or sim 2 & also u need to long press to change sim1/sim2 to send a message.3) calculator is pretty basic without any converters like currency,date,age ,speed etc.4) there is no automatic call recording option. if u press call recording after a call starts, it will say automated voice to both callers "" this call is being recorded'' .which is shocking5)Battery drains faster for normal usage without even playing games. however it takes only 30 mins for 0-100 % or u just need 10 mins if u have 40% already which is big plus.6) 32 mpx front camera with sony sensor is not really great. i have redmi note 5 pro which deliver better selfies than this.back camera is ok with HDR. without HDR it makes skin wrinkly. i wonder why??7) on whatsapp video calls front camera is not at all good. i have fiber net speed connection but it makes my face look very wrinkled, and noisy. No clear face is coming.. i dont know why :(8)Screen casting to my VU TV  is not working at all . im still trying, but it makes phone freezing and i need to exit from screencast everytime. Never connected to tv.  its  just me or everyone?? if u think these are all network issues, its running smoothly with my old redmi note 5 pro mobile !!!? so its something related to mobile issue only.And using same wifi for all devices.9) NO themes available other than the system provided. u need to apply 5-6 themes which are default or need to change the wall paper for new look.10) Appclone (Dual apps) available only for insta,fb,messenger,telegram & whatsapp. u cant use other than these apps.11) there is no call recording folder found in file manager.After searching 30 mins i finally  able to listen . why though???these issues are O.S related which were never discussed in any youtube channels they all reviewed looks specs.....but these things are always annoying me in my daily use... Small things but why should i worry always...after all its ONEPLUS.... THE BIGG BRAND... its definitely over rated in my opinion ."
"The phone works fine for 6days. And magically, on 7th day morning, it gives you problems. I have lost trust on one plus brand (i have used one plus 6 for more than 4yrs)These are the issues-1.Hangs when making a call, screen goes white and you cannot hang up, go back or do anything until call is over/cut by person on other end.2. Watsapp doesnt work! Pics thumbnails are all blur until i open them in gallery. Status doesnt load, screen gets struck and i have to close the application and restart phone.3. Hangs when playing videos or audios.4. At one point it didint even recognise my sim card. I had to restart many times to make it work.Just like that, it hangs anytime. And you have to keep restarting it.I requested for an exchange within stipulated time.And guess what, the new replaced handset started giving more troubles from day3 itself. Also, the same troubles after exactly the same number of days.My partner uses the same handset, purchased oct 2021, which works fine.Some of us who purchased this in 2022, are facing the same kind of problems. Luckily I placed a refund request quickly before it was too late."
Camera everything is ok but I've face some heating issue sprat from that everything is ok
"OnePlus Nord 2 Vs Poco F3Day 3:So I watched lot of videos before finalizing for this one. All videos said that Poco F3 and 1+ Nord are same with minor differences.So as 1+ sound far better name and brand than poco, I decided to go for 1+. I have been 1+ fan since 1+1 launch.Verdict: Poco F3 would have been better.  (As I used F1 for 3 years & previous 1+1 & 1+6).Issues:Finger print sensor is slowCamera quality is good but macro & zoom focus is very badFace recognition rarely worksPhone is biggerPhone battery works for a day only (same as poco F1)Positive:Security seems betterNo irritating advt. Poco always seems to keep reading my data including contactsAuto unlock at home is good featureCharging is fastBottomline:If you want better brand name  : OnePlusIf you want better overall phone: Poco F3Edit: After 3 months of usage:Poco or other brand would have been better.- Google assistant doesn't work on lockscreen- if open mobile at night, it's too bright for sometime and then reduce the brightness- Bluetooth connectivity issueChasing OnePlus for support, but no response"
"Everything works very well. I just have some issues which are as follows:1. front camera, kinda hazy sometimes.2. Change of accent colors requires a bit more options.3. Monochrome sensor is good for nothing 😂, could have given a macro there.Although most of the improvements can be done via updates.(*can't change the camera sensor though). So overall, a very promising device.I personally opted for this device because I used to own OnePlus 3 and it worked for 5 years. And I have other devices like earbuds, TV of OnePlus as well. Along with that, OnePlus gives me good customer service and frankly, it listens to the customer. Many a times I asked OnePlus for a feature in my OnePlus 3 and it was given in the updates.(*others also asked for it). Because of all these reasons I felt OnePlus Nord 2 is a very good device for its price."
"Good mobile, but not up to the mark with the price tag 30k not worth.I feel my privious mobile Nokia 8.1 was more premium than this OnePlus Nord 2.This mobile is for long term, after using for 2 days I feel after few software updates we get to know how exactly the it perform.I have used it at a stretch watching YouTube contact at HD, FHD and 4K, and with contact reading, attending the calls, going through the specifications, and doing with all the daily stuff it gave me battery about 8+ hour on screen time and chargers within 40 minutes from 0 to 100.Coming to pros and cons,Pros:1) Built Quality and design, simple and elegant(Strictly for working professionals).2) Touch very smooth.3) Camera, picture and video quality is very good.4) Stereo Speakers very loud and clear.5) Call quality is very good.6) Battery lasts for good 8+ hour on screen time.7) Charges very fast within 40 minutes.8) Played few games Asphalt 9 really gave me good feel.9) Ram management was good.10) Bluetooth connectivity is quite fast.11) 2 years OS updates and 3 years software updates.Cons:1) Sometimes heats even with normal usage(it may clear with software update)2) I don't feel the processor is really that powerful, MD 1200 AI it's not up to the mark on this device.3) It takes lot of time to boot when it gets restart, loading the games or apps.4) Not for heavy gamers, please avoid if you are thinking to buy it for playing games.5) Benchmarks are really very poor on this device when I had checked with my mobile, kindly check what OnePlus team had mentioned while launching this mobile(check picture attached)Over all this is a value for money if you buy it for long term like 3 to 4 years usage.Check my Nord 2 battery over on attachment.This is my 2 days experience only, it may varied user to user."
Product is working good but fear of some shocking news regarding explosion of some mobile sets still in mind so I request you to manufacturer please take necessary action to resolve the problem because it's very sensitive case for customer safety purpose.
"Got the 12GB ram variant. This is a decent phone. My previous phone was OnePlus 5T and coming from that I feel like this phone is kind of a disappointment. The width of the phone is a bit too thin for my liking but whatever. Another thing i hate is the software but in my defense i didnt know it has gotten this bad since then though.For pros, I love the buttons feel very clicky and responsive. The 65w charger is amazing, my laptop also uses a 65w type c charger so I don't have to carry extra charger around. The alert slider is easy to slide compared to the 5T but I got used to it. Haptic feedback is much better as well.Overall a bit disappointed especially in software and width of the phone, everything else feels good."

 Ok so its amazing product thing is you don't have 120 Hz refresh rate and some minor glitches and bugs when I try to open BGMI in pro gaming mode it isn't opening and screen flicker issue in Amazon music battery is hell good charging takes 30 minutes camera is mind blowing but the interface is taken from colour OS"

"One plus team has really done a good job, really appreciate the premium look and finish at first glance. Fabulous camera at this price point, amazing oxygen os experience, better speakers. Yes, the phone does get a bit warm but nothing uncomfortable. Double thumbs up!!After a couple of days of usage.1. Face unlock is just top notch.2. Fingerprint reader might be slow by a fraction of a millisecond but I really don't mind.3. I can bet that it has one of the best camera in this segment.4. Awesome performance. I tested the new chipset on a lot of games (bgmi, cod, nfs) at high settings and I didn't see any frame drop anytime.5. I didn't feel a need for a120Hz display as it offers a silky smooth and super responsive display. Didn't really face low brightness issue outdoors.6. Warp charging this phone is a whole new level of experience and is probably the fastest in phones at this price point. Battery drains a bit sooner but it's absolutely justified for a device of such capability.7. I've used the in box cover so it helped block the heat during long hours of usage. Hopefully, the issue would get resolved with future software updates.Worth it!!"
"I got this phone under an exchange offer of Rs 8000 for iphone7 (6 years old). After a vigourous use i thought to review this phone some how as it actually blew my mind.First is the screen ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Damn impressed. I dont know the process rate but its damn responsive and fast. Very Good. Big enough to enjoy any video. The pixel clearity and the brightness will definitely fall you in love with this handset.Then comes the Sound quality. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Gives a crispy clear, balanced & surround sound. And the volume is LOUD.The Battery charger ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ one gets a 65 watt charger with in the box and its damn fast. My first 100% charge took 20 mins from 38%Camera ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Lovely digital and video captures. Outstanding. Ultimate clearity both in day and night. Obviously not as pro like but definitely not less than that.Interface ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ clean and easy. Took me minutes to get used to eat.Battery ⭐⭐⭐⭐ is amazing, does not drains fast, but this some what wont please hardcore gamers. Watching daily series on this or doing daily chores are perfect with this kind of battery.Phone cover & Tampered Glass cover ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ comes along with a rough and tough signature one plus cover and a pre-fixed tampered glass.8GB Rom 128GB RAM ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐No heating at all ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Over all im bowled with One Plus handset again. No more iphone for me again my life for sure. This the best smartphone for sure ♥️♥️♥️♥️"
"After using it for around 3.5months i'm writing this review. Firstly,i would like to present you some of the pros that you get with your hard earned sweat flow money.1.The Usage- It was really good. Never hanged or never got over-heated. I'm not a heavy user but once played COD for around 1.5hrs but didn't see any significant change in temperature on the back panel nor on the screen and it ran smooth too.2.Battery life- Speaking about the power i must also mention how long it will last but i must say it really works good. In terms of battery if you are a non heavy user you can last upto 1day or even a day and some hours on the next one.3.Charging- This speed is really great and Oneplus does a great job here. You can get 35mins charging time for 1-98% but would recommend to always connect at 30% and disconnect 80-85% to have a long lasting battery .4.Camera- The most deciding factor for many, Oneplus really does a good job here too. The colours are really good and sharpness is also great. The video have a good stabilisation and colours are also great here. At a budget of 30K you can get the best camera.5.Screen- The screen quality is also good and the colours produced are also natural. I like a bit of saturated colours so have set the screen to vivid mode. Playing 4K videos on this screen is great. The brightness levels are also good for outside sun hours usage.6.Sound quality- Speaking the speakers, it really sounds loud and clear. The clarity is great if you use the Dirac Audio Tuner you can also tune according to your need by choosing the presets which really makes a difference on earphones and headphones. Bluetooth earphones doesn't support any kind of tuning from the smartphone.Now, soo much good comes with a lot of unexpected problems that no one could expect from an OnePlus smartphone.Cons:1.Servicing- Oohh,here Oneplus kills my Pros words. First ,after 3months the charging all of sudden started connecting and disconnecting automatically every 10secs and if stood connected would charge really slow say like 2hrs of charging for 20% to 90% and i went to service center for rectification. They said the cable is not working and said to come after 2hrs but after that again he said you come after 1hr and offered me a old cable washed with colin infront of me. The service person still had the audacity to say that this is a new one and asked me that its working or not as if i have asked him free cables . After a bit of quarrel finally he said after 2days it will be in stock and you will get it. After getting a new packed cable the problem still presisted.I went again after 9-10 and they said to change the motherboard and asked me to have a backup of the data on that. Finally the changing of motherboard solved the problem. But Dear Oneplus , if you are reading this is it so that Oneplus started giving up on their motherboards too?The day i got my device back, the alert slider is not working . It would be silent and vibrate but won't come back to general of clicked back and you have to reboot to make it back to General mode. Really Oneplus,Is this what one should expect from you atleast?The company whom i have known to have a great lasting time of around 4-5years and more is doing this to new smartphones?Its now mine also that the alert slider stopped working, my friend's Nord and OP7 also had same problems and they atlast exchanged for a new phone."
"The phone is great performance-wise. The battery is average, but the 65W fast charging will surprise you. The front camera is a 32mp camera but isn't good under low light conditions. Back camera is good enough!If you just want great performance with good enough battery that will last you a day and you are not a selfie addict then go for it! It wont disappoint you. Design is also really good and premium"
"Worth your 29999The best part of this phone is charging it charged within 30 min. If you want to keep your battery healthy please charge phone between 15-20% To 85-90% never charge 100.This phone gives you the best charging speed,Camera awesome, 1200 AI equals to 870 SD, OIS WORKING PERFECTLYusing for last 4 days no issues were faced.Screen is really fluid as they said.Overall if you want to buy a phone with class in 30K and with exchangeJUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GO FOR IT."

 1 st thing I purchase on primeday sale received 28th july, i was so happy but after two days very disappointing heating issue, then battery draing fastly, next OS missing oxygen Os experience i really more expected but mixing colour os is so worst all thing is hard in settings, please don't waste ur money go for other mobile"
"I bought this device 12GB/256 version considering that can use without any issue. Earlier I was using One Plus 7T, so I was confident regarding the quality, but post buying this one plus product, I am still thinking why I have bout this scrap thing.It has overheating issues from day 1, camera started to lagg just only after 10 minutes of video recording.I have filed a complaint in Amazon and their technicians found the device faulty but they are replacing not refunding. As I think replaced device will perform in the same manner. Still awaiting for my replacement after 3 days of complaint.I would suggest dont go for it.. It is not oneplus it is oppoplus."
"OnePlus Nord 2 is accompanied with Mediatek Density 1200 SoC which is quite powerful in terms of organization producing it. I bought OnePlus Nord 2 (12GB RAM and 256 GB storage) through Amazon . I wanted to return this device but, the return policy for Amazon is 7 days only which made a loss of 9k for me. When it comes to performence first week was fine but, after 10 days it started showing its true nature. First, don't know why it started burning up at the processor side of the phone🔥. I thought of over usage may be but, I remember it neither I have used it to its maximum potential and also I am low key user. Second, while charging the device it started burning up again thought due to charging this happens but, I earlier used OnePlus 5, OnePlus 5T, Redmi Note 6 never faced such issue while charging and being a Mediatek Density SoC it shouldn't. Third, Ambient display feature is good but, drains your battery to a next level and the UI is not designed to show how much does this feature drains battery. Fourth, Proximity Sensors were not working at all which I got to know while I did a manual diagnosis of phone through OnePlus Care app. Conclusion: This phone is not at all a good choice for buying it with Mediatek Density SoC. If you have used Snapdragon then go for the same but don't buy Mediatek SoC mobiles at all. In the end I incurred a loss of 9k for getting rid of this phone through buy back feature which is a huge set back for android devices. Atleast OnePlus Center guys should have considered that device had issues but, the service center guy says with smile that we can't do anything submit your phone and take it back after 2 days. Any new phone buy back program should only reduce 20% of its initial price. This should be applicable to all devices in the country. Now, I own a Snapdragon 888 SoC OnePlus 9 Pro which is much more better than these low end version.Note: Please be aware of this never buy a budget phone because it is already compromised with the specifications and reduces it true value."
"Pathetic performance. Major heating issue, no support from oneplus..Have provided all debug report, necessary inputs to analyse the issue, not support from oneplus. Refer attached response after 1month followup.I have debugged by my own. Issues mainly in:1. GPU performance compatibility with processor.2. Over locked cpu caused over consumption of battery while using camera, videocall or net browse. Causing heating issue3. Lagging of power consumption optimization and 65w charger causes heat during chargeIf you still interested, after performing os update, go to advance settings and adjust refresh ratio to 90 hz and reduce GPU cycle. Switch off GPU performance logging and all other back end performance reporting logs. This actually may help you reducing the heating issue. But that's just a temp fix. OnePlus has to take care the problem seriously."
Worst camera experience and higher battery drainage.
"This phone has a very good balance of all the features.1. Camera : Camera is good with nice colour reproduction. Photos come out clean and it's dependable in low light conditions as well.2. Battery : Battery backup is decent, not the best of all but it's good enough for an average person. A fast charging is always good to have and it charges in 20 minutes from 20 percent to 80 percent which is the average charging circle for me.3. Screen : 90 Hz screen is actually more than enough for an average user like me. Backed up with good haptics, it makes the experience good.4. Connectivity : 5G is certainly something which we will see later but for now it supports Career aggregation. Call quality is not right there as my iPhone but much better than average android phones.5. Speakers : It's like a mini soundbox. Truly loved it's speakers.Alert slider is a cherry on top.With a dependable service centres and a good software.It's the best phone out there at 30000. Go for it without a doubt."
Using Nord 2 5G almost 1 month and here is my feedback:I am very happy with this device except the battery. Battery of 4500 mAh is not good at all though you will have 65W charger which can charge in 35 mins. But that will reduce your battery life cycle count.Initially there were lot of software bugs but I have received 3 updates in a month and almost all gone.For the Netflix  no HDR support there. HDR+ available on YouTube. Here Netflix needs to add this in supported device list.Call Quality is perfect.VoLTE working fine for Vi and AirTel and VoWiFi also working for Vi and Airtel.Rear camera is superb but front could be better but not major issue.120 Hz screen refresh rate is missing in this budget may be that is for 9Rt.
"Simply Flagship killer from One plus. Fast , smooth and flawless operating system. Decent camera and sound quality. Overall enriched with features and value for money. Thanks amazon for fast delivery."
"Monile is decent,runs smooth, display is good, charging is fastBut there are some cons which needs to keep in mind1. Software- trust me guys i was using oneplus 5 from last 4 year, but this nord software doesn't feel like you are using oxygen os, it feels cheap like other OS2) too much enhancement feeling cheap camera3) getting heat alot, if using continusly for more than hour it start heating, if charging from 20 to 70 percent back will get heat.Overall this phone is for normal and light user but for techy people, for mobile lovers this is not one plus you can rely on.OnePlus days are gone now, in this price segment even vivo 60 is far better doing than this, there's realme x7 too if we rewlly want that cheap software experience."
"Primary camera undeniably fantasticnight 🌃 mode is amazingHDR image is goodStabilization is greatSelfie shooter is goodWide cam is just okIs there any other camera 😑(mono-worst)Performance is great when efficiency mode turned onBattery when efficiency mode turned off is bout 6 hrs of sotCharging 0-100 in 32 minsDisplay is good outdoors but there is some problems seeing under direct sunlightColours are good and viewing angles are great90hz is just same as 120 no big differenceTouch response rate shall be increasedBuild quality is good as of glass and plastic sandwich.Bgmi works fine no frame dropNo 90 FPS but u can use config file to enable.That's it folksHope it helps u to make decision,😄(3 days review)"
"Overall the phone is very good. For me, the camera quality is good and the battery lasts for a day with a single charge. The fast charging charges the phone within 25 minutes. The performance of the device is also good you can play most of the games without any lag. The handiness of the device is best and it is fun to use this phone for reading and along with a 90Hz display, it is a delight for the eyes. One thing I don't like about the device is that it does not provide call recording without announcement and I think it is a software privacy issue and the fingerprint reader does not work even if your fingers are slightly wet. Front-facing camera can be improved. Overall I am happy with the phone in 28k."
The phone gets hanged every now and then & about camera quality its not even as good as my old Oneplus6 !Fast charging and battery life is excellent.Finger sensor is not so accurate ..Slight heating issue which is common in every Phone.OnePlus is getting the same features just by hiking the prices but Nord is comparatively ok but with respect to price not so trendy or nothing new !But still the craze for oneplus never settle
Reviewing after a month of use:There were some bugs but with timely update everything is sorted now.This will heats a little while charging and playing high graphic games i.e. PUBG & CODM etc etccamera is totally awesome in dim and sunlight as well.If you can't afford a premium phone then it will be the great option for you.
Heating problemBattery draining too fast.Need to charge twice for normal use. Not recommended
"The OnePlus Nord2 phone for me is worth the price. It's surely is an upgrade for me and though I was highly confused with so many reviews about phones in this range, I am glad I went for it.The battery is superb. I am a normal user (don't game much and watch and listen to music at a normal to high level and browse social media platforms every 2-3 hrs). The connectivity is good (bluetooth, wireless and network). I love the VoWiFi option (didn't have on my Oneplus5) and display is superb. Haptics are nice and charging is unbelievably fast. So for regular users like me this is surely an option in the top 2 or3 if you are looking to buy a new phone. OnePlus as a brand  is still worth spending a little extra for as of now."
"Writing review after using this phone from last 15 Days..Prose1. Camera good quality 4 rating2. Touch screen- very good, working properly.. both face lock and finger lock work excellent.3. Display very nice 5 rating4. Charge superb... 💯 % charging within 30 minutes ....5 rating5. Dual speaker working properly 56. Battery life ...not upto mark..3 ratingBig Issue:-Bater drain super fastIf you are normal user then 1 day life.If you are moderate user..2 time required for charging in a day.Havy gammer/ YouTube ... required to change 2-3 time in day...Recommendation:Battery capacity need to be upgrade with higher capacity..."
Very happy with the delivery by Amazon... hopeless battery...does not stay for even a day...fast charge gets to 100% in half hour but the 100% does not last even a day wit conservative use..makes me wonder if they're showing 50% as 100% in a make-believe operation....also the first news I read the day after buying the phone was about the phone explosion in bangalore...finally good luck trying to find a screen guard in the stores
"Based on previous good experience with OnePlus bought this one ( even though it's from china!!).Now, i bought, set up, switched from old phone to this phone. Thought all sorted. I realised random calls were going, messages were getting sent etc. It's due to pocket mode not working !!Called customer care. They asking me to bring the phone for repair and it will take two weeks.Ridiculous. Please don't buy oneplus. This is simply not acceptable. They should've given a replacement phone and sold this as refurbished."
Sold after using 3 months after hearing explosion news
"Only problem is battery draining fast(5-6 SOT).No bugs, no lag, camera quality  drastically improved but ultra wide is pretty avg and what i dislike is slightly red tinted in 50mp non hrd image processing, fast and smooth. Everything is good."
Initial impression is good. Lot of granting permission in the beggining which might seems bit irritating.Apps getting crashed during uses due to storage issue.Little bit of heating issue was there at the beginning but now it is totally fine.There were some issue related to storage..everytime getting message : 'Clean up storage to download the apps from play store'.Even with all the glitches after doing one Factory Reset..everyting working fine now.Main Camera quality is crystal and mind-blowing. Front camera may be bit hazzy but still it do the work after some adjustment.Battery life is working quite well..played COD for more than an hour and battery consumption was only 18%. Pretty much does the work.No lag during game play.Overall UI is awesome.Value for money 💸💰..
"1. Overheating issue!  Phone heat like oven, while using camera/video it feels like its gonna explode soon. that much of heat  coming out from the phone.2. Mist coming around camera.!!  After say 5-10 mts of usage, there's a cloud of mist coming inside the camera, and after that, all the  pics we take look blurry.  I've attached the photo of it. have a look at it3. Lame Customer care!!  I made a complaint to customer care, and they couldn't solve the issue, they said they had to change the  motherboard and ruined the phone completely. I'm gonna file a case in consumer court. Their handling was awful, I got scratches and switch damages.  Verdict!!!  Don't buy this phone at any cost. I won't recommend this crap phone to anyone, Don't waste your hard  earned money on it."
Don't buy this scary device

"I'm writing this review after using the mobile for a month. This is my very honest opinion.Earlier I was using Redmi Note 5 Pro. The main reason I bought this product for its processor and camera. My review might contain some comparison b/w my last low budget phone (10k-20k) to this mid budget phone (20k -35k).Pros:1. No ads2. Super Fast charging is very good: With in-box charger, it took half an hour for full charge. But this will only work with oneplus warp charger. The mobile also supports slow charging (better for battery life) with in-box charger, but there is no option to use/set it manually, it is auto, mostly at night time.3. Night mode works good, just you need to hold it for 4 seconds.4. Primary rear camera is very good, but other two rear cameras are just for display.5. 90 Hz display is good.6. Small onscreen button in corner for screen rotate function which appears automatically in bottom when it is needed.7. Slider to change to ring/vibrate/silent. A nice feature.8. The processor is fast enough for me, but I can't say for others as I'm not heavy gamers or video editor.9. UFS 3.1 storage is fast for file transfer b/w pc and mobile10. Onscreen fingerprint is more convenience.Cons:1. Battery life is short. For normal users, you might need to charge it twice. So I think it is not suitable for travelling.2. Selfie camera is 32M, but selfie photos looks like low budget phones. BIG disappointment for me.3. Secondary rear camera can be better. Third (2M) rear camera is useless.4. Boot time is high.5. Peak brightness is low. Only issue if you stay in sunlight for longer time.6. Although there are no ads, but you can not remove pre-installed google apps. like youtube (okay for me), youtube-music, google duo, google play movies, google photos. I would prefer to remove them.7. App clone is sh*t compared to what I used in my last Redmi phone. Only support for few apps like whatsapp, facebook, telegram, but also I cannot access their data folder. I need to access my cloned whatsapp folder which I used to backup data to my laptop using USB cable in case needed.8. Sometimes it hangs too. I noticed it when using the camera. I hope they fix it with future update.9. Calling app is not good.  a. warning for call record, tried multiple apps but nothing works; also other Oneplus phones are snapdragon based, so their apk can not be installed in Mediatek based nord-2 . now I have stopped using call recording.  b. if you use video call feature( which can be used when calling b/w same sim operator), you won't like it. very small round block of your video (you can not know exactly what other is seeing) and that too is fixed in left corner. Cannot hide it or focus on it,  c. if phone gets locked while calling, you cannot use fingerprint till you are in call as no option to see onscreen fingerprint sensor to place your finger. You can only use calling function else you need to cut call and unlock and then call again.10. I feel in-built apps like Gallery, file manager and others have very limited and basic function.11. whenever I try to access my whatsapp folder, it takes significant time to show content of my images/videos in whatsapp media folder. That was not the case with my last redmi phone. Both whatsapp are of same size (6GB).12. Once I gave my bluetooth earphone to service center. I felt mobile should have 3.5mm jack, also oneplus type-c wired earphone are too costly (Rs 1300) where as you can get 3.5mm good earphone in Rs 500.I hope it would help others to make a good decision."
"The best out therr.. just don't go by specs, the feel is great, i had used OnePlus 3 in the past.1. No heating issue2. Display is crisp 90Hz is smooth.3. Phone is Fast, you won't feel any lag4. Aah camera, the sony sensor sucks all the light into it. Trust me nord 2 has the best low light camera out there in the segment.5. Warp charge is crazy, 10-90% in 13 minutes, its insane.6. Oxygen Os is the best clean OS, yeah they are migrating to color Os, yet the feeling is great.(that's y 4 🌟 else this one deserves 5 🌟)"
"Price: Bought on republic day with instant discount of ₹3,000 so actual price is ₹27,000.Phone weight : even though it's 190g it doesn't feel that.Display : i always looking for small display size, my previous phone was redmi note 7 pro, but compare to that even though screen size slightly larger than that phone but I don't have any problem. Display color is awesome, no complaints.Camera : main back camera is the main thing which is excellent. Even though I like front camera also but some of my friends is not happy.Battery : i was concerned about battery life but it's also more than sufficient for day usage. Be aware while charging phone it's just take only 14 minutes from 15% to 100%, charger is very fast.You can't insert memory card in this phone.Overall best phone of if you are looking to switch in premium brand."

 Using since 4th January 2022Likes:-1) Screen Good.2) Sound Good Both upper part & below.3) Software is fine performing with different apps & downloading is fine & Smooth.4) Cemera Selfie-32mp Good.Rear 50mp with Sony lens very Good.Vedio making is smooth with zoom in & out 10x.Night Photo Quality is super.5) Bluethooth connectivity is Good.6) Battery drains as & how it is used with screen & sound quality enhanced drains quick. But its 65w charger is superb enough to backup quick within in 25-30mins from 1% to 100%, I personally experienced it 3times.Dislikes:-1) Fingerprint is sometimes not ok, missing 3times to 10times.2) Gets Heated Enough especially Front screen, While using Photo Editing app, Such as PRISM ART APP.Quite often it gets heated whenever I use the app mentioned above."
ProsSuper fastBeautiful colors and crisp displayAwesome night photosConsCamera sometimes puts fake colors of sunlightIn normal light conditions the contrast exceedsCamera hangs when being used continuous for 5 mins or soFingerprints takes around 2 seconds to identifyOverallIf you buying for camera then other one plus options are betterIf you buying for gaming then expect sporadic phone crashesIf you just want to buy for normal use then other cheaper and better alternates are available
Awesome camera best charging speed and the most proper clutter free OS
"If you are not a hardcore gamer and know what to expect from OnePlus brand, then this is the best in the segment.Coming to the Oxygen OS merge with Color OS, if you are not aware, even older devices like OP6 received the same updates (minus camera improvements) and it is much much better than the bloatware shoved in Mi/RealMe/IQOO devices.Camera is decent (all thanks to the decent sensor) but there is room for improvement in processing.You wont feel the battery to be inadequate thanks to the fast charger.Elephant in the room: Heating issue. Yes, if you use your device while charging or do hardcore gaming, heating is definitely noticeable (a lot).I have purchased this mobile for my mother and she is happy with the overall device, camera, screen brightness, charging speed, gaming capabilities. So If you are not a hardcore gamer, go for it."
"I have been a big oneplus fan. Used their one plus 5 for 4 years. Never had any problems no lag, no problem of hanging, good battery life and a great camera quality. Then I started facing some software issues and bugs so I decided it was time to move on with times and get the one plus nord 2. It's been almost a month since I have been using this phone. And WHAT A LET DOWN. Horrible camera clarity. The brand seems to have regressed interms of its camera. I have never been so disappointed with a phones camera. And over all usability is also not very smooth despite the fact that I have a 12/256GB varient. The display clarity is also below average and a let down. Doesn't feel like a fluid amoled display at all. Video quality on 360p seem poorer than they should. Over all I would like to give them a ZERO especially for the camera, the screen quality and over all usability. Please don't waste your money. Might aswell buy the iPhone 11"
"I tell you honestly its not a 35k mobileits a simple Chinese phone...camera average qualitybattery drains fast but charger is superbusb otg not suportedmany times signal lost... if anyone calls you they hear that not connected or out of networkwifi is very very slow even on 5mhz networkone thing is its most admirable that phones processor is outstanding,but overall phone is below averagebuy on your own risk"
"What ever the news spread of blasts of phone is there with few units. But I'm using it from 3 months now, not a single issue. The best camera phone in this price range, even better than 9r I can say that. Cuz used both. All other stuff of phone usage is butter smooth.battery is little less...goes on a day but the charger is the best ever thing with this. Juices up in no time. Great job OnePlus Hope it remains the same as well. At this price range video quality is super cool and the day to day usage and ram management is top notch. Extraordinary performance with games as well. If the blast news isn't spread. Then this order would be the best smartphone of the year. But hope all becomes safe and secure.Hope so"
"Its going to be a detail and honest one.i took a good 20-25 days to test it and wait for the update and then experience the update.Pros:1. Nice built and design with both side Gorilla protection. ** but be careful to protect the protection :D with back cover.2. display quality is top notch3. Rear camera is satisfactory4. Fast, furious RAM. 8gb is more than enough for a daily use with avg gaming unless you need more size to save files.cons BEFORE any update:1. Worst battery life. Drained so fast. Literally, water dropping from tank with big hole.2. Heating issues3. not very impressed with the front camera quality.Pros AFTER 2 updates[directed to last cons]:1. Battery management is improved significantly. i can use it for 24 hours in normal uses without lot of streaming and continuous use and thanks to their wrap charger BEAST. charges 0-100% in just 25-30 minthe good thing is the phone already have a built in battery management which is so smart and it prompts you kill unnecessary apps.2. Heating issue is slightly improved. i think these 2 are inter dependent.Cons AFTER 2 updates:1. slight heating issue. can be ignored.2. still not very impressed with the font camera quality."
"I have purchased this mobile in a month ago and every thing ok,now I am facing an issue with battery in the starting days the mobile charging is excellent when I was used all most all social media apps,but now when I keep the charging in the morning it's was down to 30 to 20 % in the same day I called to the cc and explained my problem they initially told some settings and off the mobile and run in safe mode every thing was done but there is no much difference ni found and the cc team saying which app will consume more charging they were asking and the initial days on wards I m using the same apps but that time I haven't faced any Charing down issue after using one month I m facing this issue..I was dispoined..from one plus ..This is the review I have writing after one month usage of mobile"

 After using 5 Month today I found it is worthless phone,During 1st Month of phone, It is heating bit and gradually issue increases day by day.adding to this, phone hangs a lot. Everyday I need to restart my phone 2-3 times.Phone is such a slow that some time I feel that I am using 4GB RAM phone.Pathetic Phone i have ever purchased.recommended not to buy OnePlus Nord 2.Don't buy any product from Amazon, worst Amazon customer service in india"
"This is my first One Plus phone and I'm two minds about it, it's been over a week of usage now, some places it has impressed me and some places it js straight up disappointing. I just noticed that it has stopped fast charging, I don't know why. It was working till today morning and today evening I decided to charge my phone and it took 3 hours to full charge, the battery is draining relatively quickly as well. There is no gaming mode in this phone so gamers please don't buy this phone, unless you want pop up interfering with your gameplay. The only good (decent) part about this phone would be camera which is decent for the price. Apart from that, idk, wouldn't recommend you to buy this phone. Can go for an Iqoo 7 instead. Bought that as well, worth every buck"
"ITS A CORPORATE PHONE I WILL CALL. ITS KIND OF INCOMPLETE ALL ROUNDER I WOULD SAY. I'M A VERY HEAVY USER. ( HEAVY HERE MEANS I USE MY PHONE FROM 8 AM TO 12 PM YOU CAN SAY ) MY HONEST OPINION I WOULD SAY AND NOT REVIEW.PROS) 1. Great build quality2. Good rear cameras. Decent selfie cam3. Awesome charging4. Performance is nearly flagship.5. No major heating issues.6. Speakers are fabulous ( top notch)7. Perfect size. You will love the in hand feel.8. CALL QUALITY AND NETWORK IS AWESOME9. VIBRATION MOTOR IS FLAGSHIP I WOULD SAY.Cons: 1) average battery backup2) not for gaming i would say as it is not comfortable to hold while playingBGMI3) NO 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK, THIS IS THE MAIN ISSUE I'M FACING WHILE GAMING WHEN I USE C TYPE EARPHONES IT BECOMES MORE UNCOMFORTABLE TO HOLD AND GAMING ALSO DRAINS BATTERY VERY FAST WHILE GAMING.4) SCREEN IS GOOD BUT NOT SO BROGHT IN OUTDOOR SUNLIGHT. BUT IT IS OK.FINALLY I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE NOT A GAMER AND A MODERATE USER. GO FOR NORD 2 BLINDLY 8 + 128 IS SUFFICIENT IN MY OPINION.."
"I'm a 1+ fan and I had used 1+1,1+3 and then 1+6 and now I bought 1+Nord2. This phone is excellent but thing is 1+ oxygen OS is the reason I liked 1+ products. But in Nord2 I have to face some downgrades in OS like there is an Google dialer in this phone insted of OnePlus own dialer and same this happens with the messanger too which I hated most . Although I have no problem with changed camera UI because 1+ camera UI is not that great. Plus there were also not that much customisation as compared to my 1+6 but still this Nord device really performing well and works really smooth."
"So I've finally upgraded from my One Plus 5 and the Nord 2 doesn't disappoint. I'm impressed with how good the phone performs and have listed its pros and cons.Pros:Amazing Display: Sure its not 120hz but the 90hz display is still good and its great for multimedia.Processor: The mediatek 1200 Ai is impressive and runs very smoothCamera: Have to say that the camera is impressive and a huge upgrade over that trash One plus previousy sold. It's camera is better than the Mi11x and Iqoo 7.Design: The grey siera matte design is great. It feels really good in hand and is perfect for the minimalist.OS: The OS is smooth, intrusive and easy to understand. Though there has been some changes with the addition with color OSKudos to amazon for its quick delivery.Cons:None so far, maybe the lack of headphones jackTo sum it up, its a great phone at this price point with its camera, os, and performance. For everyday use and multimedia, this phone is perfect. It's about time One plus went back to its roots and have delivered a promising product."
"After using One plus 6 for 3 years, decided to upgrade to Nord 2 5G. But am thorougly dissappointed of the product especially because of overheating and battery drainage. Reached out to customer care who had me format the phone twice. It worked ok for a few days but the problem came back. I am using the same apps and similar usage as my previous phone, so customer care's apprehension that apps running in the background are draining battery sounds ridiculous! Now they want me to wait for OS update to 12. Did not expect this from One Plus."
"All the features are good except below cons.Cons:1. Mobile is getting heat while using camera2. This mobile is not supporting for HDR video playback in Amazon and netflix OTT3. screen size would have been little large. Mobile width is looking small. As it is 30k price, expected size could be bit large4. Battery is draining little fastPros:1. Battery charging is super fast. Getting full charge on less than 30min2. Camera is good, having more options.3. Display is super.4. Sound quality is also good5. Processor is almost like Snapdragon. I don't feel difference"
"Don't buy any product on Amazon online shopping because they giving defective phone and I reported to customer services for my phone having heating issue, hidden problem & display brightness issue, cemara clarity etc...so they told me that we send to one technician person for resolve & diagnosis ur mobile phone, but no one came to my home for diagnos my mobile checking and again I complaint for this issue he said we have another process sir like u should download blancco mobile diagnosis app in Play Store, we try to solve ur problem through app, so I download it & he checked & diagnos everything and he said me ur phone having heating and some defective hidden problem what you noticed so we intiate replacement ! but I said that I don't want same mobile because if repeat the same problem how can I trust you? so I asked him can you please I want return only..he said that I convey message to my senior I'll let you, then I believe after that he put my called on hold and next second he cut my call. Again I called them no response from Amazon so complaint against Amazon & OnePlus in cybercrime at Hyderabad."
"Nice product, first time charging took 45 minutes to make it full from 0 to 100% battery. Really quite impressive and half day passed with light usage of cet consumes 21% of battery life, am convinced. It has 65w warp fast charger, usb to c type data cable, stylish sim ejector, transparent silicon back case, default screen protector, branding sticker for back cover. Missing headset and lack of expandable memory card are the missed out features. Its ok, with 12gb ram and 256gb of internal memory, memory management is quite suffice. Need to buy c type headset separately, it would be great if it is provided as a welcome goodie.😜"
"Update:Pros: Good looking slim phone,display great. battery backup is very good.Sound output is amazing.Cons: Not expandable. I feel camera is ok not great, better to go for vivo x60/70 series for camera."
"I have been using this phone for the last 10 months and it is still under warranty. 10 days ago a blue spot appeared on the screen and within a few hours, most of the screen turned blue and could not see anything under that blue patch. After searching on the web for such issues, I came to know that this is the AMOLED screen leak and can happen anytime. After giving it for repairs ( under warranty and hence supposedly free), I was told that there are supply problems for OnePlus parts and the said screen is NOT available with the OnePlus service centre.  So far 8 days are over and when inquired today, I was told the replacement display is still 5 to10 days away.This is ridiculous. I can live with gadgets getting faulty since it can happen to any device any time, but the unavailability of service parts due to which mobile is NOT available to use is unacceptable.Spending 30K on the phone and out of 12 months of warranty, if it's down for 20-30 days, will OnePlus extend the warranty by that many days?What's the big idea if this so-called Flagship killer brand is unable to service its device due to a lack of replacement parts.Also, my other experience with the ear buds is also not great. After a few months, there's a charging problem.Will go back to Samsung."

 After only 2-3 months phone started hanging a lot. For a smartphone with 12GB RAM, this phone is slow as well as hangs a lot. Cannot search and open any app. It takes many attempts to open an app. See the attached video proof. It is very time consuming and frustrating. I tried formatting the phone but still same issue. Customer support does not help at all, they ask you to visit them multiple times. I have 2 OnePlus phones in my family and both hangs a lot. They have good marketing but poor quality products and poor customer support."
"Writing review after 2 months of use.PROS:- can show-off to very few people (for those who can't afford iPhone)- main camera is very nice- alert slider is very helpful- sound is awesome (phone speaker)- very good build quality- face unlock is pretty fast, like it's already unlocked- fingerprint works wellCONS:- portrait mode is not good if there are no human subject- battery lasts for 1 day- flashlight is less bright (compared to Lenovo p2a42, my previous phone)- works as wifi extender when I connectswith mobile data then switch to wifi (happens my macbook air 2017), othewise my mac keeps disconnecting 5-6 times before a stable connection.- sometimes caller id not appears- frozen notification for whatsapp call (while calling is going on)- sometimes notifications are not shown (for music)- sometimes notifications don't disappears in AOD screen- lacks in features compares to budget samsung phones- battery saver mode always on...even if you turned it off (my adguard keeps stopping in background, also asked in official forum, tried every possible way to keep it awake but it keeps stopping)"
"Have been using it for last 2 months and the phone has good battery and performance for everyday work. I used camera extensively during my travel and found that photos were good in day light, but video quality was not that great  when compared to my previous 4 years old  Samsung S8 camera quality. I bought this phone after seeing good review on dxomark website and assumed OIS does good job for photos and videos but not. However, photo and video quality is far better than some of the Xiaomi / poco phones my other family members are using."
"Overall it's a Good phone with some minor problems. Display and Sound quality is great but I wish the display was a little brighter especially in outdoor conditions. Primary camera is great, wide angle lens is plain bad, 3rd camera is useless. The main problem I have with this phone is that it tends to get warm with minimal usage over period of time. Getting warm for gaming or camera is ok but warming for general usage is not. I hope OnePlus fix this.Otherwise it's a good phone for regular users, I haven't faced any lags or so in my usage. The UI is also very good. I don't care whether it's oxygen os or some other os as long as it runs smoothly (and without ads😉). This is far better than other crappy UIs out there. Battery life is decent not that great. For a heavy user like me, I have to charge it again in the Night. But charging is phenomenal. It just takes 35min to charge completely.If you want to buy an all-rounder phone for general usage with good primary camera, occasional gaming, good ui and better 5g support I recommend you to buy this. But if you want a gaming centric phone or an overall better all-round camera phone and Ok with bloatware and ad filled ui with very little 5g capability you can go with iqoo7"

 Here is my review after 15 days of using this phone.Pros1 - Good and vibrant display, 120 hrz is overrated. 90 hrz is enough for a daily drive phone.2 - Sound output from the speaker is absolutely amazing.3 - Desing and looks fantastic and in-hand feeling is premium.4 - Absolutely no lag in day-to-day usage.5 - Network and connectivity is in flagship-grade6 - Smooth gaming in lower settings absolute no lag.7 - Flagship grade main camera.8 - Haptic is Awesome9 - No issues with UI even after color os integration.10 - 5g band is more and good 4g+Cons1 - Front-facing camera need improvement.2 - No 3.5 mm audio jack. is a scam.3 - 4k HRD at 60 fps bit laggy and not smooth4 - Phone get hot in higher setting gameplay5 - Chin could be less.6 - Ultrawide camera overwhelming.Conclusion  - If you are a person looking for a good camera, good in hand feeling, good battery backup, gaming maximum of 2 hours a day, content consumption in ott, smooth day-to-day use. Trust me this is the value for money by one plus. I Will not recommend heavy gaming. This is a very good phone for working professionals."
If you buy one plus nord 2 and if you use any Motorola mobile then you realize look and feel of both the phone is same. So if you r planning to buy One Plus nord 2 for Rs.30000 then better don't waste your money to buy one plus nord. Because there are other brand also provide same kind of configuration in lower cost.Good thing is performance and its camera are impressive.
"I am first time using OnePlus.I have watched videos on YouTube before buying this don't follow that.Really this is the best Mobile.Quality of Camera 📷 Beautiful, too good.Battery 🔋 OnePlus provide 4500 that goes  one day. It's sufficient because we can charge this only in 20  to 30 minutes.Really it's amazing. First time I thought about it but when I am continuously using this have no issues.I plugged charge this when I m going to take bath and ready to go office when I come it's fully charged. It's amazing. With 65w charger.OS is also good.I am giving 4.5 stars 🤩Just 1 thing is bad 😞 in the phone is no expandable memory and music jack is provided.Overall the phone is too good 👍😊I m fully satisfied."
"This was delivered in 3 working days for a PRIME MEMBER and this is not expected. i thought will get it in next day as mentioned in the description.writing this review after using 45 days, There are some hanging issues some times. example is while talking in wahtsapp video call, my video is hanging always after some time. this is always there till today same issue. Battery life is good first month but day by day battery draining within a day, initially it is 2 days. ALso this Oxizen OS is not that much good not user friendly. i dont like this OS.ONe plus should fix all software issues on priority."
"I bought this phone after watching the review that the camera is very good however it is not. When I clicked pictures from back camera from a distance the face of coming like it has been made with some app, it's not at all good. I checked with all the diff settings one could have done with camera to see if I am not using it correctly but sadly nothing worked. Then I asked for a refund which they denied and sent a mechanic at my place which said that it's OnePlus fault and will be corrected in the next update. Finally I got a replacement which is working somewhat fine then the previous. But still not fully satisfied.Other than that the battery life is good the charging is extremely fault, but if your buying it for its camera then it's a big NO"
"Well....the tagline says it all. EVERYTHING YOU COULD ASK FOR.Its a practical bunch of features with an amazing best in class camera. It outdoes a few flagships out there as well. The primary sensor in this phone is outstanding. Battery life is brilliant and will easily get you through the day even with heavy usage. The Amoled screen is good too and you won't really miss a 120hz refresh rate unless you're heavily into gaming. The integration with colourOS isn't really an issue unless you're an OxygenOS purist. I moved from stock Android and i would say I haven't been irked by any nuances of the Android skin. I really like how the adaptive brightness quickly learns if you don't like the screen too bright. Lastly, Mediatek has outdone itself with its Dimensity 1200 AI. You won't even realise that you have a ton in background apps running until you actually check.Would recommend anyone looking for a phone in this price point for a practical daily usage phone. For gamers, you'd be better for off with the Poco F3."
"The phone does not contain any flagship level thing for any part like processor or camera or display. But the overall combination of all makes it a complete package. Like the Camera is good enough but not extraordinary, Amazing night photography with the help of OIS and image processing, display is very good, Processor speed is very good, FP Sensor and Face unlock works fine. Most significantly, the OS, Oneplus never compromise it.Things that could be better:1. Image processing of both font and back camera could be better (Green is not so vibrant and does not give actual color after processing, RAW Image is fine) which can also be fixed with software updates. 8 mp ultrawide sensor could be better. Also macro option is missing. 2 mp sensor is worthless.2. Under display FP Sensor never works as fast as back or side mounted sensors.3. Battery performance is adequate for one full day 7-8 hour usage.4. Snapdragon 870 could be a better choice in this price.But this processor also does pretty well for day to day usage. ( I am not a gamer).5. Camera UI should not be changed like oppo."
"Hello friends,Whoever buying this phone after watching YouTube reviews that's it's agood phone should avoid this phone. there's is no return option eventhough your phone is getting heated or exploded.The only good thing I find its looks like a descent phone with good rear camera not super,smooth UI,alert slider.Apart from that it's a hyped phone,battery draining issue even in idle stage,background application run without opening,unexpected heating when kept in pocket.I strongly recommend Realme GT series /Vivo IQ phones over OnePlus phones.Don't think give it a try and it will explode for sure.Just check news on daily basis.I'm carrying a OnePlus bomb and no customer care gonna help me.Hope this information saves your money and life."
"I felt like this oneplus Nord 2 is Best in oneplus nors series. It's worth of 30k. The 65w warp charger is just amazing that your phone gets charged from 0% to 100% in just 30mins. I did not not felt much heating issue. Frequently close the recent apps and clear the cache. If you strain the phone too much it will obviously heats. Camera is excellent . Display is just amazing. Phone runs pretty fast with Dimensity 1200 AI. If you are confused with 9, 9pro and 9R, would definitely recommend Nord 2 because it's worth the penny. 9 and 9pro doesn't make any sence with the hasselblad. Not much different with the cameras. It's seems just a hype. Go for Nord 2 you would save 10-20k comparing with the other 9 series."
"Improvement required for below scenarios -1. Battery life should have improved which is not worth for this price.(Actual battery - 4500mah, expectation - 5000mah plus)2. Camera quality is not that good specially front camera.3. Design should be different it looks similar to previous OnePlus Nord.4. No IP rating which is too bad for this price.Other than these above disadvantages mobile is good for normal usage and you can go for it.If camera is your main expection then please do not buy this mobile. Daylight photos are normal but shots from the ultra wide angle camera aren't good at all."
Now a days anyone fight for their investment. At the rate of 30k OnePlus Nord should perform better than other competitors. People don't need brand. They need quality with their investment. OnePlus satisfied but not surprised. I'm giving overall verdict that best performer with best built quality of phone and charger but not battery. Roughly used mobile users are not preferred this cute mobile. But it's preferred like psychopaths.
"This is the first time i bought any phone, and within few days i felt like, why did i buy this. I tottaly regret to buy this phone. I mean i have used Oppo and Samsung my entire life. But the selfie camera of this phone is worse. I mean it feels like...as if we are clicking pics from a 2 Mega Pixel camera. And also my phone started showimg technical glitches from 2nd day itself. I was recording videos and they were not getting saved in the phone. i had to restart the phone again and again. I seriously dont recommend this phone. And i dont even understand why people are so crazy about One plus."
Would come straight to the point about Nord2 (8Gb Ram Variant)Pros -1) Sturdy Design2) Fast WiFi connectivity3) Surround sound and loud speakers4) Camera is good for amateur photography5) Toggle switch for Ring/Vibrate/Silent modes is a good features on this phone6) MediaTek 1200AI is fast7) Battery Life is good. Heavy users can expect a full day usage easily.8) Charging is really fast. 65W charger charges the phone from 15 to 100 within 40 mins.Cons1) No 3.5 Mm jack2) 410 PPi feels pixelated sometimes if you look very closely but colors are very natural3) No 4k at 60fps but a concern for Content creators only not for average users.Would suggest you guys to download Nova Launcher as I personally feel it really brings the best out of this phone in comparison to Oxygen UI.
"I was using 5T and changed to this one (12GB/256GB).The major issue I face is on Android Auto.This is not getting connected on my Car, whereas the Connectivity on 5T is with ease.Another issue is the handset do not switch to Mobile data automatically, once the Wifi connectivity is not there. Have to disable wifi manually and then only mobile data gets connected.Really irritating"
I was initially looking for One Plus 9R but ended up buying One Plus Nord2 as both have similar features and costing of Nord2 is almost Rs. 10k cheaper.Pros-1. Good Processor2. 65W fast charging3. Fingerprint reader also very good4. Good SpeakerOverall functioning is quite good but I personally didn't like the battery backup. Its almost same as One Plus 6 which I was using earlier. Also it does not have Headphones jack
"Features which I feel Worth buying are 1.camera 2.65watts warp charger 3.display 4.stereo speakers 5.allways on display loved it 6.touch response was awesome .A bit confusion while buying this device about its camera performance especially front one.but OnePlus has whipped up all my confusion with its camera features.it taking about 30mins for full charge from10% which giving me confidence even when my device is at low charge I could plan to go out with in 15 to 20min.no words to explain about its display quality , speakers and haptic feedback,Definitely feels like using flagship mobile.A major con is that its brightness is not sufficient when using it outside door midday.Overall it is a device with fully loaded features Worth buying at that price range.."
"While it is a good phone at this price level, it is a little buggy. I moved over from 7T to this. Was skeptical on media tech but for my use mostly office (Outlook, teams and phone call) along with a little social media and little OTT and little small games like Candy crush etc it is really good.DO not like where the finger print sensor is... but now used to it. It is quiet low. Many time I have ended cutting a call while trying to unlock the phone.The UI is half Oxygen and half Colors so not very happy but it is what it is."
"128/8GB Blue Haze.I was using one plus 6 since may 2018 @33k 6GB/64GB bought it in first sale. And it was my first one plus phone, before this i used to love moto g series phones .Now wanted a change so bought this. My review is based on the experience comparing it to one plus 6.Build quality : Will give full marks 5/5 i liked it when i got the phone in my hand.Camera :Back-I am disappointed with camera. Op6 camera is far better than this the colors are very natural on op6 compare to this.Front: don't use much even on op6 so won't review, for me its okay on this device.Battery🔋: 4500 mAH comapare to 3300 , my 3 year old phone still runs for full day on full charge but this one little disappointed, attached the screenshot. In last 3 days this didn't go for full one day. My usages are mostly: whatsapp,slack, hotspot, mails, chrome etc. (NO  or very less music on loudspeaker, games I don't play at all.)Charging: just one word impressive.Display: Good not found much difference then op6.UI: definitely not good , don't like the navigation, caller app and recording alert to other user is very irritating, any time i open some app one or other t&c permissions very irritating and true isuues.Sound: much better than op6, stereo speaker is very nice.Overall good but when i look at my 3 year old phone which i bought at around the same price which in so many ways better than this, its little disappointing. I don't see this phone as upgrade to op6 except its 5G which i don't think is coming in India in very near future"
"This phone rocks!At first i was hesitant to buy it because of it's price. But last sunday i meet to my friend jayprakash at his room then he advised me to sell chaarpaai and coolar if i wanted to buy this. I had sell both and some other things because these were not enough. Never regreted my decision. Such balanced sound  and highest picture quality that it can't be matches whatever you want to do -  play games, watching movies listen music- this phone runs smoothly  in every case. There is one problem though - my friend is sleeping without  chaarpaai and cooler."
"Display does not wake up sometimes even if it is charged. Needs to restart the phone. While switching off, the phone flashes white screen. The phone delivered 5 days before writing this review. The issue already happened 3 times. There is no option to replace the phone now. Amazon only gave option to order Mobile Phone Inspection Service. The inspection will going to happen after 2 days. Will update the review after the inspection experience. Hope I will get replacement of th phone.When the mobile is working properly, it runs smoothly. Features are good. Camera is good. Worth the money if it doesn't give any trouble."
"Camera:As someone who loves a good camera and processor, this phone meets expectations. However thr front camers defaults to a bit higher exposure that you need to tap and correct sometimes. Should be fixed with a software update.OS:Many are complaining that Oxygen OS doesn't feel the same, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter.What you have in this phone is a very smooth experience for any of your tasks.Thr battery:The battery charges CRAZY fast!!It does last a day for me for medium usage."
"2 days of usage and this is what I experiencedThe battery gets charged as quick as it gets drained. 65 watt is must have , otherwise you will use the phone while is always plugged in.The display is good, however could has added 120hz instead of 90Audio quality is sufficient not that dynamicCamera quality is a catchProcessor seems ok but need more time to confirm on that.Finally it is a respite to have alert slider back.Final say: it is an awesome device if you are using OnePlus for the first time. However at this price, OnePlus could had done better."
"I like the overall features of this phone.Yesterday i received it with 2days prime delivery.i did it full charged.After 24 hrs of used n charge is still 48% remaining.Quality of the touch is so smooth to use.I like everything of this phone.Only there is a bit drawback with the camera.Pictures taken with is phone is not so clear and look some yellowish..But yes,if anybody is thinking to buy a phone within 30k,then definately can go for it."
"I generally do not review products on Amazon that I buy.. but I had to for this purchase..I research a lot before buying a new phone because I use it for long.OnePlus Nord 2 is an amazing phone. I don't know why people are giving bad reviews.  For me it deserves 5 star.1. Battery- I am a normal user. Battery easily lasts a day. Charging is super fast- 100% in 30 mins.2. Camera- I don't click many photos. But the one's that I have... have come out really good.3. Gaming- Runs smooth. No heating issue.4. User interface and experience- It looks premium and UI is also very smooth.5. Connectivity and browsing- excellentOverall- If you are looking for a great phone in 30k, then you must definitely go for it. For normal day to day activities I surely recommend this."
"Phone was only usefull to showing people that we are also using 1+(it's not ONE PLUS it's ONE MINUS). But it's 200% ZERO stuff in all aspects like CAMERA, CLARITY, SCREEN, BATTERY, ACCESSIBILITY, USER FRIENDY and most importantly THE DEFAULT APPS, all these are just for the sake but not atall update sand not really usefull.Finally this phone is an purely AN LOW CLASS CHEAP CHINA PHONE that we are buying at HIGH COST.I am totally unsatisfied with the performance and software. Like thay captioned it's never settle. Need to update more."
"I have using this nord 2 for past  six days I can say the performance of this phone is good but not class leading when I played asphalt 9 i noticed several frame drops at high quality settings also 60 fps is not available in asphalt 9 .In terms of pubg the phone performes decent enough.At first when I received the mobile it has some heating issu but after three days of uses the  isuu got fixed automatically I don't know how it's happened and about the UI I don't know why they giving Google dialer and massaging app u just can't record any secret conversation and the flotting animation of that massaging app is trash it's so jittery . The fingerprint sensor of this phone is avarage , camera quality is good ,battery life is decent  overall a decent phone."
"Using the mobile since one week , this is my first one plus mobile.Pro'sDesign.............9Blue Haze color u definitely love it.Software & performance.....9Camera quality.......8.5Battery life......7.5But 65W warp charge, full charge in 15 to 20 mins thats save ur time.No need to buy mobile cover its in box.Good Fingerprint reader.Con'sBattery drains little fast would have given more MHz.No extended memory card , no 3.5mm jack need additional gadget for usage.No IP rating.competition has 120hz refresh rate display."
I have purchase it before 7 day and very disappointed by operating system if oneplus have already best os then why merge colour os very bad experience with operating system most features are not available and recently blast fear keep me away from my phone dear oneplus if you can't focus on customer need oneplus brand condition will be same as NokiaMain cons1 Not full oxygen OS2 auto call recording not possible3 battery drain too fast4 fromt camera quality bad than 12000 phones5 phone blast fearPron1 looking pretty2 charging very fast3 display qualityPlease oneplus consider customer need otherwise you will be same as Nokia
"Here are my main issues with this phone:1. Battery: even though it only has 90hz display compared to 120hz on other similar priced phones, the battery on this phone not very good. Especially the idle battery drain is very bad. Overnight I lose around 10% of charge everyday.2. Heating: The phone heats up lot especially during charging and camera use. This along with cases of this phone blasting is very concerning.3. Performance: There are no major lag issues, but there are some annnoying stutters here and there.4. Camera: camera was one of the reasons I baught this phone. Every reviewer was saying camera is excellent and best in segment for this phone. I would say the photos are okay, but in some cases auto hdr makes things look too saturated and unrealistic. Coming to video, 1080 60fps looks like 240p the clarity is trash, there are some annoying stutters in 4k 30fps and 4k 60fps is not even available. So expect get good video in 1080p 30fps only... Even then its nothing outstanding.Overall oneplus needs to work on their software as this phone has decent hardware. Also they need to resolve blast issue asap or call back these phones.This is as of 18th Sep 2021"
"Beautiful colour GREENWOODSBattery backup n charging is superb ,Camera is good but not as satisfactory as their oneplus 7 PRO, my earlier phoneDisplay n resolution does seem like a cheap phone for those who used 7 pro/ series.Lighter in compared to other 256gb storage n 400mah variants of oneplusYet to check on heating issues but noticed out of 2 sims, only one has VoWifi option"
"I don't why the youtube community discourage this phone but it's now a month I have been using this phone and is the best ever device in 2021. Please don't hesitate, don't keep any second thoughts just go for it. One plus is one plus and not just ant brand out there and thanks to Amazon for providing me huge discount offer I got this product some what near 20ishhh. And I am delighted about it.."
"Been using this for a month now and happy with the experience.Assured security and OS updates with a near native Android experience minus bloatware was my primary requirement. This phone gives all of it and more.The phone goes from 40% to 100% in about 15 minutes, and that's one feature I love - no need to put the phone on charge overnight. The phone charges fully while I finish my breakfast.Fingerprint sensor works in a jiffy, a distinct improvement from OnePlus 6T I have been using for last 3 years. The camera works great for me. I am not a gamer so cannot comment on the gaming aspects.Also it's lightweight and slim, and the speakers work just great.In summary a great choice at the price from OnePlus."
This can't connect to my sony WI XB400.After spending 5 hrs with customer care.. talking to abt 8 CS agents . the only solution I got is -Keep buying headsets till I find one compatible.. or wait for lockdown to get over so I can personally go to a service center on a weekday and get the device diagonised.Till then I have to happy with the money I spent onThe phone(that supposedly pretty much everythin I want) that basically doesn't have wireless audio unless I buy Oneplus Budds or buy wveryhting in the market till I find something that is compatible with the phone.
"This is a piece of junk, packed in a super structure which highly overpriced. This phone should NOT even cost more then 15000. I don't know, what is so special about OnePlus.  This TELEPHONE is super slow, poorly designed UI, limited choices, limited options and limited qualities. Hangs a lot. I have still not transferred my entire data from my Huawei Honor 8 Pro. I will rather buy Honor 8 Pro again rather then this OnePlus piece of brick... I will not use this phone,even if it's given Free...It's only one month of usage..."
"The fast charging is the amazing feature of this phone - it's up to 100% in no time.  Don't even have to worry about battery life now!Rest of features are good - to usual OP standards.I'm  not a big mobile phone fan,  in terms of having the latest and greatest, it just has to work well without any glitches and be easy to use.  Otherwise most phones are: same as, same as, if in the the same price category.  This phone does the job admirably.256GB storage is important - espeically if have you a heavy Whatsapp storage requirement, put downloads, videos, music on your phone, like I do.  128GB doesn't cut it anymore.Overall, highly recommended."
Primary 50mp is super. Best low light camera in this segment but ultra wide and selfie is comprised. Missing 4K in ultra wide.
एकदम अच्छा मोबाइल है मैं इसको 1 महीने से यूज कर रहा हूं बहुत ही यूजर फ्रेंडली है और इसका बैटरी में कोई प्रॉब्लम नहीं है कुछ लोगों के रिव्यु पड़े थे मैंने कि इसकी बैटरी जल्दी गर्म हो जाती है तो ऐसा कुछ भी नहीं है बहुत ही अच्छा मोबाइल है यूजर फ्रेंडली है इसके अलावा सारे फंक्शन बहुत ही सॉफ्ट तरीके से काम करते आज तक का मेरा सबसे अच्छा अनुभव है मेरे पास आईफोन भी है पर उससे भी अच्छा है कोई इसके बारे में गलत बोलता है तो उसको कुछ नॉलेज नहीं है या उसको मोबाइल चलाना नहीं आता फाइव स्टार में इसको दूंगा
"I have never expected such a pathetic product from one Plus. This is my second one Plus device & I have been using this since 2 months.=> From the look wise the phone is looking very good=> Sound is very pathetic. I can hear the sounds like in old cheap chinese mobiles. Very loud & not clear at all with buzz sound.=> Though the pictures are appearing good, they look worst when zoomed (especially people's faces). Photos on One Plus 7 are pretty good when compared to the photos captured on this device.=> My device has 12GB RAM. Though the performance is good, the phone stucks sometimes.=> Battery backup is good (More than a day with medium to less usage).=> Screen protector provided along with the phone is of worst quality. Bubbles started appearing within just 2 months usage."
Nice Product...Pros:Super fast with dimensity 1200Charging speed is very impressiveOxygen OS customization is niceBattery backup is also good.Cons:Oneplus feel is not there after merging with oppo.Camera and settings doesn't feel like oneplus.Mixture of oppo and oneplus is clearly observable.Could have had faster display of 120 hz.3.5mm jack should have been given.
"A honest review Afer 48 hours of use.After going through Ithe recent negative reviews back to back,i was lil skeptical whether to buy or not.but i took d risk.muat say the product is gr8 piece from oneplus.the camera is awesome to be honest.the battery life is good,not d best but its more than good.u have a high power charger which charges from 0 to 100 in 35mins approx,the speakers r superloud and supports dolby atmos sound .connectivity is good..overall i good deal ...sierra grey looks elegant...Go for it blindly."
"I saw really good reviews so i bought this one, taking good camera for granted. The front camera is anything in the low range phones(shocking), rear camera is good, video stabilization is given on both sides .Battery life is around 6-9 hrs on normal usage, fast charging is insanely good, takes you from 10 to 100 in less than 30 minutes.Might feel a little bulky, given the size.The back looks chic! but since it glass and its slippery, you're not going w/o the cover so no point.There are some nice features which arent necessary but cherry on the top."
I was using a 10k honor phone before this. It was far superior it this phone. It has 8gb ram but get stuck every time you play a video in you tube or Netflix . Videos get stuck. While making call if u are connected to wifi then call ll get disconnected many times. If u r using mobile data or wifi videos will buffer even with YouTube . Data usage software is not at all optimised. Display brightness is low. Hardware specifications are on the high side but performance is very poor I think software is not at all optimised.  Human subject is shown with poor quality in images. Camera performance in day light is poor .
I've been using it for almost 2 months. And I could say this really a value for money from OnePlus. I feel battery backup could be improved. Daylight camera is good but low-light camera is really surprising. Sometimes it heats up even though it's not being used heavily and sometimes the temperature is very normal even though I'm playing game for long time. Sound quality is very good. I found the only major issue is heating issue. Dimensity 1200 is giving a lag free experience and for that mediatek should be appreciated. I'm only concern about future ColorOS update. It's a request to OnePlus to keep the OxygenOS as much as OxygenOS.

 Video calls automatically drops on Google Duo ,get freezed on whatsapp and same with other apps . The Green notification light for camera turns off that time means the camera stops functioning .Twice i visited service center but the issue still persist now they are not ready replace my device and just calling me to service center again and again , my time and money got WASTED.DON'T GO FOR THIS DEVICEthis is full of bugs .Checkout the video ....i focused on the same object and you can see in the small scree it freezes after few seconds and then the call drops."
"If you are searching for a mid range One plus phone with good camera and performance, then it's the ultimate buying option.Camera quality is too good. You can click very good photo's also perfomance is awesome, no lag or anything of that sort.Coming to the negatives, the battery drains faster but you don't have to worry any more, with the wrap 64W charger phone gets full charge within 30 mins.Since the OS is new, there are few niggles in the operation like, horizon light not working and a unknown warning kind of sound comes whenever there is new notification. Hope this will be fixed in the next update.Overall very good Product. If your budget is around 30k then this phone is ultimate option."
Day 2 of using it -1. The phone heats up way faster by just using it.2. The camera seems good haven't used it much to understand whether it's up to the mark.3. Takes about 15-20 mins to charge to 100%4. Display is amazing. I played a game and the display quality was amazing.5. No problem with the finger print so far.6. Speakers are good but I am disappointed that there's no ear jack. Gotta get a wireless earphones now.Will update this review in a week to see if there are any changes (good or bad)

 With the NORD 2 OnePlus seems to have gone back to their roots - flagship killer. Though there's nothing out of the world in this phone, but whatever is there, seems to be of good quality so far. I am not very impressed by the camera honestly, and the Color OS elements are visible at many places like the camera app is not that great either. It has been only several hours since I have received the device, I might update this review later.Note - While the photos of the greenery and laptop are taken by the NORD 2 itself, the photos of the phone and accessories are from an Ipad"
After having used this phone for a couple of days I realised that it’s an overhyped phone. There are too many bugs in the software.The fingerprint scanner is not accurate.Gallery crashes when sharing a media file.Oneplus smart switch keeps disconnecting while transferring data from old phone.These are just a few of them. Overall I am thoroughly disappointed with the phone’s performance. Would definitely not recommend buying this.
"The phone is truly a flagship killer since it provides certain premium features at an affordable price. It might also be the only flagship killer from OnePlus this year.Positives: Charging is amazingly fast. I upgraded from OnePlus 5t so the difference is phenomenal. The processor does a good job of competing with snapdragon 870 and is up to the mark on most factors. Camera is decent enough is low light conditions but quite good in sunlight.Negatives: Battery drains fast, especially during processor intensive functions. However, the fast charging more than compensates for this. One issue I noticed was the phone hanged and restarted one time when I paused Netflix and the screen locked."
First of all they compromised with Oxygen OS. And now....Camera is goodScreen is OKToo many bugs.....(OnePlus was famous for bug free experience)Bugs comes back again and again...u have to restart the mobile to fix them.UI is good in such price.Overall except those bugs....u can go for it....but remember these bugs
"Straight to the point: As confirmed by one plus customer service/store(Saket-delhi), note the following;1. Oneplus offers only 7 days replacement window from the date of purchase(not when you receive your phone) for amazon users. Whereas, direct purchase from the store gives you 15 days replacement window.2. Nord2 has been reported for screen going black/ blank. It is a manufacturing defect(as confirmed by service centre),a hardware failure. The same case for me, but the service centre immediately refused for phone replacement citing only 7 days return window which I was not aware of.3. Amazon dosnt provide any warranty & repair Service. Actually, I was happy seeing the button ""Avail service""and benith written as ""available now"", upon clicking it gives this message ""No warranty support resolution is available for this product at the moment on Amazon. Please check the product detail page for brand contact details to avail warranty support"""
"Today is the 50th day, tested almost all the features in it. So here is my observation :1. Battery life - above 'above average' - may last for 1 day if not an active user unlike me.2. Battery charging - EXCELLENT - 0 to 100 in just 25-30 min.3. Camera - not great - will not capture the entire beauty of a location. But for non camera users, its great.Wide angle photos are not up to expectations. Visual colours in reality might differ from pictures from camera.4. Speaker and audio - no need of buying external audio speakers. The speakers in this device has it own league. I personally use just 60-70% volume while using it.100% volume will tear your ear tissues.5. Heating issues - absolutely nil.6. Phone looks and feel - slim and sexy. Premium feel.7. Phone usage - I'm 20 and this mobile is more than enough for all my needs (dont know about social media apps as i dont use any of those platforms).8. Overall - great one. Go ahead."
"Liked its camera, sound quality and storage capacity.But battery drains easily(very poor charge retention ), not slim at all and the worst is the call recording feature which intimates the other person, whose call is being recorded. Why company is installing this feature without customers consent.How can we keep privacy while recording the call. The next problem is non detection of usb. Everytime we have to remove the phonecase and insert. The company should correct all these."
"It was one of my dreams to hold the best OnePlus mobile in my hands and my dream come true with this mobile. I have used this mobile more than 4 months and writing this review.1. Best mobile with premium looks2. Amazing Display and screen refreshrate3. Awesome camera with so many inbuilt features like Dual video and Slo-mo. Low light photography is also good.4. It takes only 30 mins to charge fully (Super Fast Charging).5. Network connectivity, call audio quality is really superb. I really appreciate sterio speaker which is outstanding.In my overall exp, this mobile is standalone and one of the best option below 30K."
"For those who don't want to read essay:On-hand feel(green woods): 5/5, it's premium.OS experience: 5/5, clean & smooth.Camera: 4/5, captures decent pics.Display: 5/5, JNCD.Battery: 5/5, Massive performer.Charging: 5/5, yeah it got the speed.Heating issue: no for normal usage, for gaming li'l bit."
"I was using One plus 5T for last 3++ years and enjoyed the phone performance but this Nord 2 5G is no where comparable to that phone. This Nord is quite heavy , audio quality is like a local phone, not a great camera etc etc . Overall not worth the 30k spent.Do not consider this as upgarde for existing one plus users. May be the first time one plus users might like it. Disappointing purchase."
"I'm writing this review after a two weeks of usage. I'm changed to this phone from my OnePlus 6, after a 3 years of usage and it's still young and works smoothly. From that point of view everything is better and upto the mark expect the os. As a fan of oxygen os the things are changed a lot in so many areas. I only stuck with the OnePlus is because of the Oxygen os and it's personalized features. This changes make me very bad and have to consider other brands in my next upgrade. In camera app, settings and so many areas they made a mix of colour os. Also dialer and message apps are run in orginal stock android experience and no oxygen os customisation In hardware and other performance area it's worth buying and no issues with that. I'm not a gamer so can't say anything about this areas.Also seeing lot of reviews from other people and my experience this is the best phone by OnePlus in 2021."
Very vad camera quality by oneplus very disappointing  my old phone mi brand is price 12k but camera better than oneplus nord 2 please don't buy this phone if you want good camera quality.... This oneplus nord 2 model making foolish showing 50mega pixel camera.. Front camera is also Very bad... If I have a option to return this phone......i am very happy... Total money waste.... This phone Not for good camera lovers
"one plus nord 2 has bad heating issue, it heats up bad even if have travelling in regular sun..Heats up in just 10 mins video recording with breaks... Even during charging.I trust the burst complains that have been seen as it heats up to dat extent.I actually sold the phone for a loss ok 6k...i m ok to take loss thn d fear of bursting"
"It took 2 days time for getting on the phone which didn't respond properly, received only adaptor and anyhow tried to manage with the other charges available with us in the home. And after the mobile got on. The charging was going down quickly without using any apps & the touch screen also not responding properly sometimes.Also didn't had a earphones jack to the, expected alot and purchased the One Plus mobile but got utterly disappointed with this.And to raise a complaint also matter didn't got sufficient in 1 column to explain the multiple issues so raised multiple queries.Don't know how and where it will take to the extent.Especially purchased this phone based on charge expectation only but in that 1st step only went wrong.I request the team to refund or replacement with a new device.Thanking you,"
"I am not a heavy user of the camera, but what I use extensively is the phone. And this one is brilliant.- Font options & Display is brilliant- The charger is what I love - this phone gets fully charged within 15-20 minutes. That is absolutely insanely brilliant for a heavy user such as myselfThe one thing which is a little painful is that the Ring-vibrate-off controls for calls & notifications are three universal settings controlled by a mechanical ""switch"". I find this clunky and difficult especially if you add your own cover on the phone.That said, this is an absolutely marvellous phone"
"Nord 2 review after 28days. Note that I was a Redmi Note 5 Pro user for the past 3.5 years.Pros- Excellent build quality. Feels definitely premium and top notch in hand feel. The protective case provided is good too.- Primary camera is great. OIS helps in better night photography as well. Front cam is ok- Battery life is admirable. Lasts a day, easily. 65W warp charge helps regain battery in no time.- Oxygen OS feels ok for me. No lags, no irrelevant apps or notifications. Maybe because I was annoyed with my previous MIUI which had annoying ads & notifications. But for existing OnePlus users who are planning to buy new OnePlus devices, the new ""Coloured"" change might not be pleasant.- Dimensity 1200 is too good for an above average user. No lags or frame drops. I'm not an avid gamer, though I was able to play BGMI in HDR & Ultra FPS settings @40+fps. Don't know if it's good fps for a phone at this price range.Cons- Display - The AMOLED display is okay for most part. But of you're an extensive outdoor user, then Nord 2 will be a disappointment for you. The screen could've been a little bit brighter under direct sunlight.- OTA updates - So far, I received 3 updates. But after the first update, the phone booted up with a Chinese message. Check out Geeky Ranit's review, many had the same issue. They could've made their Chinese identity less obvious.- Haptics - I now feel like the haptic feedback has been reduced after OTA updates, even though it's still good. I was just referring that they could do the same with every aspect of the phone over OTA updates.- No telephoto lens. Only gimmick monochrome sensor.Verdict: If you're a value for money guy + gamer, then Realme X7 Max is the right phone for you. On the other hand, if you need premium in hand feel + brand value + better camera and a clean UI then you can go with Nord 2. POCO F3 GT falls in between, I guess. If you don't need a flagship processor, then you can also refer Moto Edge 20 Fusion @21.5K, with stock Android, even though it's still Chinese. Indian users don't have many non-Chinese options to choose from. It all comes down to personal choice."
"OnePlus nord2 is my first OnePlus phone.This phone is well built,Sound quality is very goodCamera - front camera good and back camera is very goodI didn't try games yet (I am not the frequent Gamer)Movies videos quality, sound and audio are very goodMusic quality awesome.Very smooth for usingCalls quality is very clear and goodHighly recommended to buy this Nord 2"
"selected over samsung and Mi, regretting, oneplus is overhyped.My experience with mi was best.1+ overheats, hangs, settings get chenged on their own.Access to settings was easier in Mi by sliding down notification bar.Display settings change on their own and its so irritating.Even keyboard gets changed on its own.Camera is OKAY.Screen is small..no fun in watching videos as i am used to large MiMax2OVERALL....REGRETTING"
So I got this phone delivered on Monday and the first thing I was excited about was the oxygen OS from oneplus and as soon as started using it the fasting I notice is heating issues it a lot specially after the latest update and after using it after sometime if you keep it down then it cools down fast . So I got the Amazon prime so I use the Amazon prime music and I got the bug in Amazon prime music due to the old UI of Amazon music there are black lines on the screen and I did not get this with any other apps only with Amazon music rest everything is fluid amulet and fluid smooth at 90 FPS. Enjoying the oxygen is a lot and really is best mixture of stock Android and customisation. Just hoping that oneplus profits the under 12 update and fixes the box and mix this phone most stable for more use and hoping to use it for next couple of years.
I have been using this phone since a month now.Pros:-1. It's warp charge is really amazing. The battery charges in 20-30 mints depending on your current battery percentage.2. The sound quality is good as stereo speakers are provided.3. The back camera is amazing. Takes clear pictures in night.4. The ring slider is a plus point here as compared to previous Oneplus Nord series.Cons:-1. The front camera is not as per the expectations. Onplus 7 takes better images though.2. The bott sleaker could be placed parallel to the top one for better stereo sound experience.3. The ColorOS based Android system is not as customizable as Oxygen OS provided in Oneplus 9 and 9R.4. The 3.5 mm jack is missing which leads you to buy a wireless headphone. A plus point if you already have one.
All the features are above average but cant be compared with one plus 8 and 9 series. Camera quality is good - decent. Battery charging time is great but battery life is average. Many type of personal data is shared with the phone manufacturer but cant help it as if you disagree most of the features would be of no use. Screen size is good and display is very nice. To unlock the phone you have to either first press lock button and then fingerprint or double tapa and then fingerprint meaning you have to do atleast 2 steps to unlock the phone by fingerprint. Face unlock drains lot of battery so have to turn it off eventually.
"Only 2 drawbacks that made me rate the phone 2 out of 5 are 1st i bought the phone based on its camera quality and latest imx processor in it. But to be honest it didn't do any justice. A phone thats in a range of 30k should have atleast made the camera far more better.Leave zooming of pics, which I dont want to talk about, a normal pic looks like a water colour painting. ESP when you are taking pics of ppl in bright day light.2nd I would say that finger print sensor is not that quick. There is some lag while compared to others.. but not that bad. Hardly few more micro seconds more. But it counts.-Final verdict: if you are looking for a phone with descent camera never go for it pls. Else for rest of the features I would rate it 8.5 or 9 out of 10."
"I have been using OnePlus mobiles since 2014 and have very good experience of OnePlus mobiles. But, this oneplus Nord2 has completely destroyed my faith not only in this mobile, but also in the company's service. This mobile does not allow you to upgrade patches, softwares. You have to take it to the service center. The oneplus service centre people are also very unprofessional. They will waste your time.Overall, oneplus has also opted the path of Nokia and it will achieve the same fate."
"decent mobile with good battery life for daily normal usage, it runs for a day and half for me with meeting calls 1- 2 hours, social media 1-2 hours, YouTube 1 hour, i am not using it for gaming. performance has no issues you can have multiple apps running in background, charging is fast , camera is good in night mode and indoor , image becomes blur if you try to zoom a little bit for photo taken in 50 mp which is not expected. for potrait mode from back camera seems focus is not automatically adjusted you need to put some efforts if you are taking photo of a small things. outdoor photos with AI mode ON are very good."
I'm got it for 29.5k. And using this phone for past 3 days. Here is what I felt about this phone while using.ProsBuild of the phone is greatSound is crisp and clearOptimization of OS good have not found any lags so farBattery performance is top-notch and charging too.ConsLag of many appsCamera performance is ok .. not at par in comparison with the competition like realme x7 pro. Not saying its useless but not greatDisplay feel a bit dull in direct sunlightHaving a bit heating issues while using continuesly4g support is laging at time. Feel faster at time and very slow at time. Maybe a network issue not sure.Overall it's a decent phone. This phone is for those whose preferences are1. Great build2. OnePlus brand3. Oxygen OS4. Camera is not priority5. Great battery performance and charging
"If good camera is your priority, like in my case, then this is a good choice, although with a catch - picture qualities are superb, but if you take videos, the phone heats up pretty quickly.Battery charging is superfast, but even with normal use of watching videos or insta, it lasts for about 6-7 hours only, which I believe should not be the case.To Sum Up-Camera - 5/5Battery - 1/5Charging - 5/5Performance - 2/5 ( due to the heating issue)*It once got heated during data backup on drive, to a point that both front and back sides were hot enough for me to shut it down immediately.But I am still going to use it for the camera for atleast one year. Hoping, issues gets fixed in updates."
"The product isn't the flagship killer phones OnePlus used to sell, I don't know if the OnePlus 9 still has that oneplus spark in it but this one is a disappointment. The phone keeps lagging with the apps, literally every minute now. I had a OnePlus 5t before and I can promise, that phone worked better after 3.5 yrs of usage than this one after 2 months. The battery gets up in 25 mins but that's no use cause it gets down by 10, max 12 hours. The camera is the worst thing stuck on this device, wouldn't stop lagging for a minute and is totally worthless like the oppo cameras(which is used on this one). The only thing I liked about OnePlus phones is the oxygen os which is still there in this one but it seems a lot buggy. I am just hoping that the updates solve them all. Yet if I were to recommend it to an enemy, nah I won't."
Pros : OnePlus Brand (lost its image in my eyes already)Cons :1. Battery life giving us a hard time2. Earpiece is faulty3. Bluetooth connection drops on itself4. Earphone output volume5. Google assistant doesn't work6. Issue with MAC id n wifi connection7. Heating issuesI have wasted my hard earned money. Looks like a substandard product. I have requested a replacement. Hoping the new one comes in perfect condition to cope up with the emotional and financial distress caused with this piece. Had been reaching out to Amazon numerous times only then I was able to place a replacement. God knows how the new one gonna work..will update review after we receive and use the new product.
"Compared with some other phones in this segment only.Go for it if you want to give out a statement that You could buy an iPhone but you didn't because you don't like iOS.CAMERA: Back camera does a decent job, night mode is good. Front camera is very very poor, you'll have to unlearn taking selfies.Fingerprint sensor: In-display, works 3 out of 5 times. The sensor doesn't get activated sometimes when you raise your phone.Battery: Gives you 5-6 hours of continuous usage.Charging: Amazing charging speed. very fast.Speed/Lags: You don't expect a 30k phone to lag/freeze but it does that sometimes while taking calls. Sometimes the light sensor doesn't really work.Display: Fairly goodSound: Audio is not balanced with front-firing speakers. At full volume, it sounds like an old Chinese phone."
"Phone was Delivered on 18 Jan 2022 and got Dead on 3rd Feb 2022, when we have visited to Service center they denied to repair under warranty as per them phone was opened earlier, for same have complained to Amazon even amazon denied and said we can not help you need to speak with Brand.we have visited to another Services center after some days they also said phone is opened and issue of your phone motherboard this will not cover in warranty you have to pay Amount of INR Apx 18,000/- to get Repairi am just stuck, don't understand what to do, new phone which was purchased in  INR 29,999/- and no one is going help in under warranty"
"I am a loyal OnePlus User I have used OnePlus X, 3 and 5 before this Nord 2.Compared it thoroughly with OnePlus 9 but this phone wins every damn time!Good CameraGood BatteryAppropriate size smaller and lighter than 6-7-8-9 and 9Pro.Worth the price and the blue looks really nice.Comes with a screen gaurd and a transparent phone cover added with charger and USB cable."
"The phone is great, the performance is optimum.The geekbech scores improve if you turn on the high performance mode in battery optimisation (for those who want the scores to roar)The display is crisp, albeit a little dim for outdoors but that's a known thing since OnePlus clearly mentioned the peak display brightness.Netflix HDR Support is still missing.A few glitches post the software update, like the app cloner (Parallel apps as per previous OnePlus OS on my OP3T) fails to detect whatapp and other apps, I had to reset the phone to fix the issue.The support for the device on OnePlus app is still missing, no extended warranty for this under the red cable club as of now.The back glass (the logo on it to be precise) is layered for texture, in my case the logo is not perfectly aligned and thus gives this weird look. Refer the images below. I have raised the request to amazon regarding this waiting to see if I can get a replacement for it. Will keep everyone posted.Edit 1:1. The phones has some weird software or hardware issue(Tough to pin point as of now)2. The apps keep running out of memory, the apps keep crashing(even the phone app) so high number of call drops.3. Seems like a half baked product rolled out to hurry and match Oppo's Reno 6 Launch."
Very good budget phone... After 1 month of usage I am writing this...Pros1. Good Display2. Insane fast face recognition3. Nice finger print sensor4. I was worried about Mediatek Dimensity...But its been performing more than my expectations5. Decent back cameras6. I see many negative reviews about battery performance but I found ok ( not great )7. Insane warp chargeCons1. Software tweaks required on some areas...Like if there are unread messages in inbox u can't view the new messages from the same sender when phone is locked ( Headache when dealing with OTP )2. Very Bad display when used in a bright daylight.. you may not see anything3. Sometimes battery draining is little higher while watching continuously ( I am Compensating by Auto switch on switch off at night )4. A Concern on battery life on the long run....VerdictA smooth fast Oxygen OS with capable hardware makes this one a good buy...If battery gets updated to 5000 mah or more nothing can challenge One plus phones...
"From performance perspective this device is as good as any flagship phone in the market. Like any other Oneplus phone it has got a clean, smooth user interface. But looks like the OS needs more patches as the screen gets frozen at times.The charger I received was faulty. It stops working and then a few pats on the converter brings the life back.Otherwise I am impressed by the warp speed of charging. It takes just half an hour time to complete 0 to 100% charging.Mediatek 1200-AI SOC is blazing fast and 12 GB complements to it.However the device still doesn't support Google Augmented Reality."
"Good Enough, got in good price with old phone replacement cost and HDFC card offer seems best phone in this range rather than Oppo or Vivo and anytime best ever than Samsung."
Just received the One plus Nord 2. It's look really beautiful and the performance is also actually great! And the battery backup is not like I expect but OK.And there is something like a manufacturering defect on the side of the plastic frame there is small potion where the is this damaged black mark. I know it's a small damage but my 100% happy lvl turns to 50% just after I noticed this.Everything was perfect but only this issue so spoke with an Amazon customer service and a replacement is on the way. Thank you Amazon for you prompt support :)
"Build quality is great. Looks polished. It get the alert slider slider. Gorilla glass 5 on both side. No complaints here. Phone size is also optimal. Can operate with one handProcessor is next to flagship ones. It doesn't heat. Perform well for everyday use. I am not sure about the gaming performance. I don't play gamesCamera - Primary camera is great takes photos with great details and color accuracy. But I feel my old phone Samsung A50 had better color science than nord2. Wide angle camera takes moderate photos. Selfie is good with details. Video Stabilization is greatDisplay - AMOLED does the job very well. I don't play competitive games. So can't complain about 90hz display. I even set it to 60hz because I don't require it. Brightness could have been better. My 3 year old Samsung A50 has higher brightness than this phone. You will notice it in outdoor conditionsCharging speed is awesome. Battery backup is good. Lasts a day.OS is clean. No preinstalled crap. My old phone samsung does it every time I update. It install all the tiktok like apps on every security patch update. Oneplus needs to work on the timely software updates It didn't receive android 12 yet.Speakers and call quality is good. No complaint here. Streo speakers does the job well.Now coming to the limitations * No headphone jack * No IP rating * No Expandable storage optionOverall this is a great all rounder option under 30k. If you are buying for gaming, check IQOO / Realme."
"This phone is very quick in processing. Camera is awesome. Look is very decent and attractive. Batter life is 2 days in case of average usage. Battery charging is fantastic, 0 to 50% in just 15 min. Inbuilt features are nice. Finger print reader is very good. Sound quality is excellent. Call quality Audio and video are very good. Touch sensitivity is excellent. Display quality is superb. Phone is handy and light weight.Overall satisfied with this product."
"Hi, I am an avid OnePlus user since the day I put my hands on OnePlus 3. I have used it gifted almost every future version of it.I upgraded myself from 5T to Nord2 and i must say it is a fresh feeling. Camera is nice and storage is great. However it lacks a premium feel. You ll feel the it is a step child of oneplus and definitely not a fine piece of work."
"The title summarizes the review. It has been over 6 months since I am using this phone.It is a very decent phone. The UI experience is amazing. Fingerprint sensor could have been a little better. There is no lag/app crash till now. Frequent security updates are available. Speakers are of good quality and are loud and clear. The feel is premium. The battery charging happens in minutes. Seen it getting charged from 10% to 50% in 15 minutes. Battery backup is also decent, doesn't drain heavily which is generally observed in quick charging mobiles. Coming to camera, you will just love it. Pictures clicked look really amazing. Adding a few photos that I clicked in my recent trip. Thanks !"
"I got my phone a few days back. To be honest, it seems overhyped. The features are ordinary, at best.However, camera quality is really awesome. The clarity of the photos is super amazing.The battery drains quite fast and there are heating issues.Also, the speaker sound quality is not so good. I saw a few comments which mentioned speaker quality is awesome. Wonder if it's the case with my phone only then.The screen seems a bit narrower. Although, it makes up for the same in length."
Hard earned money spent on a waste mobile. I don't say I'm a big fan of Samsung but you get what you are looking for within your range. But this is completely disappointed me. Now I'm realizing I should have gone for a high end mobile from Samsung or a basic Mobile from Apple. I'm not at all thrilled to hold this mobile. Never again in my life. Samsung I'm extremely sorry.
"This is my first experience with one plus. There are few major problems with this device. First and foremost is network problem. So i am using 2 sim, first one is jio and second one is airtel. Sometimes what happened is  call did not get connected and neither did i receive any calls. I switched off the phone being an Indian this is the first thing we do😂 so, after switching it on i received few msgs of people who were trying to call me . Sometimes people had to whatsapp call me and remind me that this thing has happened again, switch off and on your phone. Meanwhile internet was working fine.So this is my second device which has come after replacement and there is almost same problem in this one too.Second problem with this device is it heats up during charging and calls. Not major heating problem but yeah warm type of hot.Third problem is battery drainage is fast. I have not changed much of the settings and yeah it gets hot. Since it gets hot during call battery drains quickly.Everything else is fine. Phone is smooth. Camera is good. Till now i have faced these problems with 2-3 days of usage."
"First 10 days overall performance good but later day to day performance disappointing to me. Heating problem, network issue inside my home 2g or 3g work My last mobile network good give me good speed, battery drain very fast , camera quality very badThings went south1) The mobile heated up a bit even during data transfer done via One plus switch App.2) VLC, gallery kept crashing. Videos will stop in middle and close, gallery will crash while you scroll on pictures.3) Few things are hard to find, not sure why camera need so many permission just to let you open it.4) Then came a update today morning and it hit the app cloner seems. Even with FB, Insta and WA on mobile, its not able to see it. I even reinstalled those to see if it picks it up.Dont buy this gadget"
"I am using nord2 for last 1 month. Also I don't play any games on this device. Charges very quickly(25 mins) and lasts almost a day. The fingerprint scanner is poor. Front camera is average. The rear camera is excellent. It has ufs 3.1 storage but doesn't seem very fast. No headphone jack(disappointing). The processor is ok but not as good as a flagship killer. Brightness is not sufficient(too low) for outdoor usage. Frankly I am not so impressed with any of the features. The only selling point would be the OnePlus branding and fast charging. Yes the build quality is good. You can check the low light camera performance in the images I've uploaded, it's wonderful.In a nutshell, there are too many comprises for ₹30000. You can go for IQOO7 for this range."
"Hardware (display, speaker, cameras, vibration, charging) is awesome.Software- Smooth UI but unpredictable, app closes even without giving any error- Parallel app not working after update- Update happens automatically (it should ask if we want to update or not)- Google Play Service power drain- OS not fine tuned."
"I've bought this on the first sale and I am using it ever since.Pros:1. Charging speed2. Ram management3. Camera in night mode4. Oxygen OSCons:1. Battery dischargeI am not a very heavy user, camera at night takes good shots for its price range. Battery charges very quickly but thr mobile lasts only half a day for non stop usage. But thanks to its 65 Watt charging, it charges very quickly, you can simply charge it while having lunch and you'll never notice the issue. Oxygen OS is so far so good. In hearing Nord 2 blast incident, I am a bit scared to use it, but so far I never experienced any heating issues. Sometimes it takes time to open file manager. On rare cases it may feel bit slow. With the frequent updates, those issues are going away. If you want a simple mobile which gives a premium feel, good camera and user experience go for it. Don't take this mobile with heavy gaming in mind. It can also easily tackle games but it's not thr best mobile for gaming."
"Pros :1) Dimendcity 1200 is Excellent2) Sound quality Good3) Optik Vibration Excellent4) 65 Wrap Charge Excellent5) Disigne Build quality SuperCons:1) Battery Decent2) it's not pure Oxygen Os3) Display quality Average4) Display peak Brightness Worst, Very low Brighten indore and outdoor5) phone length is too high6) Picture resolution is Worstif u buy this phone, carefully read this.It's not pure OnePlus Mobile, and Oxygen Os. it's Oppo mobile."
"Pros:1. Excellent primary camera, good selfies. Primary is even better than that of OnePlus 9 series.2. UI is smooth. After 3 updates, Ope plus has squashed most of the bugs.3. Good SoC. Gaming has been good. Without any hick up.4. Phone is on the ligher side. Feels premium.5. Haptics are good.6. Display is good enough. Feels smooth while operating.7. Fast charging. Takes no more than 35 mins to reach from 0 to 100.CONS:1. Average Ultra-wide camera. Needs to be improved.At 30k its one the best cameras, along with ultra fast charging, dependable SoC, good display and obviously the polished OxygenOS.Note: People shouldn't doubt if OxygenOS is merging with Color OS. There's hardly any issue. The plus point is, you can expect updates on time."
"Purchased on day of launch 26th July. Delivered next day.- Camera pics are good (back and front). It beautify pics, which looks very good but somehow missing originality.- Battery performance is good . 50-60% drained in normal use on day one (12 hrs). May be bit improve after optimization of some apps, notifications, etc.- Smooth operation of OS.- Wow factor is charging which is very quick. 40% to 100% charged in around 20 mins.- Rated one star less due to missing originality in pics and no wow factor except charging."
Firstly i bought this phone in the 1st sale and after 25 days i am writing this review at first the device had some glitches but after few days those were fixed by an OTA update. And now the experience is seemless thereafter .So to sum upPros:1.Camera :if you are a camera enthusiast go for it becoz at this price point its the best2.very fast fingerprint scanner3.very very premium design and quality4.super fast processor5.charging speed is super fast literally 25 mins 0-100%And many many moreCons:1.battery life average.2.software experience not oxygen os feel3.heating issue.4.screen touch sampling rate set at low by default (120hz) {refresh rate is okay at 90hz}That's all overall an excellent phone at this price point go for it closed eyes no other phone in this price point is as good.
"This phone is worth the wait I had to do for the Green Woods version. The back texture feels so good to touch. The screen is appropriately lit and does a good job of adjusting according to the ambient light. The cameras are great and captures pictures exceptionally well. The phone is fast, and light in weight. The warp charge actually charges in less than 30 mins. I would have hoped the charge lasted more, but with the usage comes more battery use. Highly recommended."
Phone gets blast
"One plus Nord 2 is a good phone with average camera. Processor, display, touck response and fluid oled display is nice. Only disappointment is the camera. Hope they improve the experience with some updates."
"Review after 2 weeks of usageThe phone is a complete beast. It is one of if not the best smartphones under 30k. If you're thinking of buying Nord CE 2 just add 5k more to your budget and go for this one. Powerful dimensity 1200 processor, amazing display, great design and a good camera. Comes with the signature 1+ alert slider too.The only cons I can think of are1. Lack of a headphone jack.2.Lack of a SD card slot.3. Battery lasts only 2 days for me on moderate usage. Might be a problem for people who use their phone a lot. The 65W charge has you covered here though, you can charge the device to 100% in 25-30 minutes, so this is not a big issue for me.Over-all the phone gives a premium feel and is great for every purpose, be it gaming, photography, regular use or just to watch videos.Just go for it."
Pros:-Good cameraGood processorGood Screen (sufficient but could be brighter compared to the new competition)Good VibrationsAlert SliderCons-Software bugs (green camera pic bwing clicked sometimes) image attachedThe systems starts to lag like hell around 5-10 FPS. Needs restart to resolve happened 2-3 times till now in the last 1 month.
"I feel like hitting this mobile to wall.Moto phone getting signal, redmi phone getting signal. But this 35k phone is not getting signal properly.No support from OnePlus, never buy this phone. Even if OnePlus idiots sell it for 20k also don't buy this phone.This phone is relatively better than 8T and 9R, ofcourse those are almost same with 1-2 changes.I should say pricing of this is reasonable.Camera sensor upgrade after so long.Dimensity is good as we want more bands of 5G support.OnePlus X 15k phone didn't support VoLte where as 7k redmi phones supported it.So while buying only we have to think.That's the main reason I didn't go for 9R.Everything we ask for..? NO, where 3.5mm audio jack.! Not even the converter we got.I just want to use new UI, I was using OnePlus X, then POCO F1 for 3 years.I didn't want to use MI phones again bcoz the UI and unnecessary permissions they ask n lot of bloat apps...Battery: 4/5Camera: 4.5/5Display: 4.5/5Software: 4.5/5Charging: 4.5/5Mixing Colour OS is definitely cherry on top. They used just what is good.Oppo Reno 6 n 6 Pro has no value now. Same camera options we get in this.Oppo camera lovers(if any) can surely prefer this.90hz refresh rate is fine for me.120hz drains battery fast, it's just option we use very rarely while gaming.."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Worst quality. The first phone hanged within 7 days. So it was replaced. The second phone has stopped working after 2 months. Extremely disappointed. Now have to run behind service centres. Will keep posted on that.Continued: Customer care repaired the phone. But the problem is back within a week. The phone hangs and shuts down if you watch youtube. 4th class quality. Watch the video.🙏🙏🙏"
"After 6 month of use phone over heating while charging and taking videos. My first experience with One Plus brand. Nort worth for money, battery charge drain fast, camera quality is pathetic bellow average image quality. After few days of use showing some problem with speaker some times down side speaker work some times not. I feel like it is the same quality of some 15 k brand phones. One plus over priced for a this cheap mobile only because of their brand value. Only advantage of  this phone is very light and fast charging. Overall it is not worth to buy for 29999 ruppes."
"One plus is an overrated phone, before this smartphone I was using RedmiNote7S(INR12000 Rs.) and after buying this Phone I came to know about following points -1. It's fingerprint scanner is have the same speed as of my old phone.2. This Phone doesn't have any notification light.3. Battery capacity is pathetic.4. In price range of 30000 a lot of better options are available."
I brought this on first day of the sale and it is performing decent as of now. Update: camera is worrest..if you love taking photos stay away.Pros:Oxygen OSGaming is excellentSound is clear and loudBattery charging speed and backup is excellentDisplay is awesomeCall quality and network reception is goodCons:Camera is worrestStains of Colored OSSometimes sound is too loud on Insta reelsNo 3.5 m headphone jackBugs in the software ( can be fixed in future updates)Overall a decent mobile for daily use and gaming and good for watching movies .
"I am using OnePlus nord 2 since past 4 months but i didn't found any single problems like hang, over heating and battery drain.Camera quality is moderate and requires software upgradation.If you compare 30K price range mobile phones OnePlus nord 2 is best.Please go for purchasing."
"The phone is just average. After a month of usage, I can say the following things:1. Slow finger print reader. I compared the fingerprint with a friend's 9R and it's way faster.2. Okay Battery Life. Even though it comes with a 4500 mAh battery, it drains rapidly even on just playing music.3. Lagging. On apps like Facebook and Instagram, the comments won't show at once or reels might get stuck. On calls: When I try to cut the call, it will not end.4. Touch sensitivity. Even when you're not touching anywhere, I don't know I click at places I don't want to.5. Camera and OS. Only the camera is the best feature and that it comes with Android 11.I was previously using a Samsung phone until I broke the screen so I decided to buy OnePlus.But I would rather go back to using my old phone.Don't spend your money if you don't have a lot. Go for a cheaper phone or a higher range phone or find something else in this same mid-range.Just average."
Pros1)Display is ultimately super for money.2)Main Camera is good but front cam is just ok.3)No issues with OS.Cons1) Battery life is not up to mark for Gamers.2)Finally Big CON is Heating issue._May be both cons only for Gamers_Note*- No issues with Game experience.
"1. 50 MP camera is not worth it for 30k and Quality is Worst than Redmi & samsung 13 MP camera. i saw many reviews and comparisons but didn't help.2. Battery 🔋 is worst like 4500mah for Big smartphone . I need to charge 2 Times in a day even I do work 8 hours office work. I mean its only 25 days and battery drain 30% to 20% over night while sleeping.3. I didn't believe this phone blast but last migh I was playing BGMI woth normal graphic settings and it became to much hot 🔥🔥 in 2 games So I thought I need wrote this review. Hope it helps.One thing I have decided Buy iPhone or Budget phone 20k, never go for middle range."
"Everything is ok,but my expectations are;1)While using in sunlight display need above 60% brightness for clear visible.2)I think they can give 5000mah battery in this model.3) Floating window option is not there for all apps.4) For grey color model I cant feel back side corilla glass is there,but officially they are saying some other technology is made.5)Some other unwanted apps are there:I cant made it as disable and even I cant uninstall it.6)I except OnePlus dial pad but it's now changed."
Recently bought an OnePlus Nord 2 5g. I am really impressed by the photo quality of the phone but the video quality is not good at all. The videos taken from this phone seem oversharpened. If you are taking this phone for video recording than I would suggest you better not invest in this device. The Colour OS is messing up the camera algorithm. Earlier the video quality of OnePlus was absolutely fantastic but now it has gotten worst with OnePlus Nord2.
"In 2019, I bought my first Oneplus. It was 7 and it was impressive. The glass back shattered but it was running smooth and camera was very satisfying. Hoped and expected same ownership experience with Nord 2. The OIS works like a charm in videos, and gives Gimble like feel. The wide angle camera is crap. The main sensor from Sony is great and night mode is super excellent. The screen looks premium though the colours are bit dull. Still I feel by spending 30K in OP7 and same in OPN2, the former is still a better offering because of all the flagship packaging like processor etc. Overall the should have been priced below 25K and it would have been a great buy."
"Material quality, display, speakers and charging are very good but disappointed on the camera. When clicking pictures of human subjects the face looks like painted. Also when images are zoomed there is very little details and no clarity.10k worth mi phone takes pictures with better sharpness and clarity. Adding to this camera application carshes intermittently and you have to restart the mobile to fix it."
"After one month use, my phone is facing a lag issue.My phone is getting slow from last two weeks.While watching videos, while scrolling facebook or youtube or so on. I already contact with customer care and by the advice of the cc executive i reset the phone.After that the phone works smoothly for 3 hours. After that the same issue again beginning.By 30k is like draw a line in the water.😢😢😢Actually I feel like using a 512mb ram phone, that much slower the phone is.😥😥😥"
"I got this one in 28k, 8gb variantPROS1. Best camera,2. Overall good processor, games like codm & pubg runs smoothly even in high graphics settings3. Overall design is premium looking, specially grey one with Matt finish, looks similar to OP 94. Display is overall good, if they put 120hz then it will be best, but 90hz is also smooth thoughCONS1. Battery is not upto mark on this phones, i casually play games 1-2 hours & got 15 to 20 % battery at the end of the day, actually it not a con, but can be better2. No headphone jack, if you are pure music listener and only using headphone jack, then this is not for you So this is my review, i think that this phone has more pros than compare to cons, overall best & value for money package I have got"
"The phone is smooth120Hz is never an issue ,90Hz is good if you come from 60Hz.Camera is good ,but there is no sharpening in imageImage got quite blurt while zoom ,may be update fix it.For business users call recording is important ,it has but it prompts users being recorded.Also note that 3rd party recorder apps will not work by any means bcz of high Google security.(Don't fall for fake YouTube videos)If above two is not issue then it's perfect phone with great performance and bloatware free with so many features."
"After continuously using my Oneplus Nord 2 for more than 3 months my Overall experience is fine but I found few drawback in this mobile.1. Proximity sensor is not as effective, it create malfunction even when slightly displaced from you ear. (compared to my previus vivo mobile)2. Finger print sensor also not much effective, It takes time to grant access or sometimes I have to put my finger several times to unlock.3. OnePlus has not given an in-built music player, i suppose it must be provided in every mobile."
"Lookwise it's great! Metal finish in the back so don't worry about your phone back catching fingerprints or dust.Only the OnePlus logo in the back so it adds to the great style of the phone.Phone looks and feels premium in hand.Camera is really great.Touch and screen response superb as usual.Battery could be better, but the charger compensates for it.Speaker sound could be little louder like OnePlus 8T, but compared to other phones within 30k it's really loud, so you won't be complaining much.Overall go for this phone rather than paying more for OnePlus 9 series."
I am Rudraditya a tech youtuber and I purchased this phone mainly to cover this on my channel but now I am using it as my daily driver (switched from OnePlus 9R)Well design and built is awesome with glass rear although frames are made up of plastic but overall it feels premium and good in hand. Display quality is also excellent with deep blacks and great contrast ratio I just wish if it could have 120hz instead of 90hz but it's manageable.You can enjoy HDR content as well.Battery life is also very good in moderate usage I got more than 7hrs of sot and you will get 65W warp charger which will charge your phone from 0%-100% in 35-40 minutes. Performance is smooth with the help of MediaTek dimensity 1200 you can play BGMI at 60fps. Camera is also very impressive specially in landscape and night shots for more info you can check my channel also for the comparison of OnePlus Nord 2 vs OnePlus 9R.
"The phone has excellent features but YouTube / Facebook video is lagging. Audio continues but video gets stuck.Phone is getting hot when you see a video. I didn't expect this from OnePlus brand which is acting as an unbranded locally assembled phone.If someone help me to fix this problem, it would be great. Rest all is excellent."
"I got defective mobile. Its video camera doesn't work well. You will get red dots in videos.Pros:Turbocharger ( Full charge under 30 min )Rear Camera ( Video camera stabilisation, AI mode, etc )ConnectivityCons:Selfie camera ( Very cheap quality in this price range )Battery drain ( if you are using 90Hz display and normal mode. Very little chance that it's going to last for a day )90Hz display ( It could have been better )Overall:You can get the same specifications in phones which are lower in price.Not worth."

 Heating issue mainly and screen cast in OTT very worst ,when call recording enable it heared by other person as call recording is one .its very worst function .battery faster drains and every time it ask all permissions why it need.i expect may be chaina hackers steal this our information. 3days to buy this phone but iam not daring my financial apps not install in this phone that means i think it is not secured phone."
"Although this phone doesn't excel at any particular field, except the software, which is the best at this price point; it does everything very well without missing on anything major. Great display, great camera, great performance, great battery, great charging speed, great build, great software, good speakers and great ergonomics. If you want a phone to do a very particular thing very well, this phone is not for you. But if you want to do everything well, without any major drawbacks, go for it."
First of all I would like to thank Amazon for the quick delivery.. when it comes to the mobile ..it's just awesome.... Looks like very premium phone... And i will give my honest review here...Pros:1) Display is awesome2) Refresh Rate : Woww3) Quick Charge: OutstandingCons:1) Battery is draining: I had little very less still it had darined out in 12 hours.2)  No 3.5 Audio jack3) Cloning apps is an issue at this moment might wipeout with software update.
Setting >Clone app >whatsapp> doneClone whatsapp pr koi bhi media file download ni ho rha no internal storage btata hai 😂😂. Ghatiya service clone appMoney loss  parallel space app hi thik hai kisi bhi android mobile me clone app bna kr use kr skte hai  phir bhi ye log  settings me clone app ka features dete hai jo ki kisi kaam ka ni bakwas
Mobile performance is okImportant:If u buy it using ICICI credit card EMI u won't get 5% cashback which was promised by ICICI.I was totally flusturated to hear this after buying it.Better Don't buy any product in EMI using Amazon ICICI credit card.I'm not sure how Amazon encourage such credit card  tricks in it's platform.
"Phone is heavy compared to all other one plus flag ship phones but is balanced well as the center of mass come exactly in between the phone horizontally.Phone heats up a lot while charging and gaming which you could feel from the OEM tpu casing.Camera is not upto the mark when compared with one plus 3 - 10. Don't buy phone depending up on camera as you will be disapointed.Gaming is good but playing in higher fps makes the game quite laggy and coming to display it feels like some low quality as it's towards dark side.Phone charges fast.Audio quality is amazing one plus won't let you down.Overall okay, could expect such phones from Vivo or other brands but never from one plus. Cheers 🍻"
This is my first OnePlus phone. I am user of Samsung mobiles. I did not find any cons in this phone yet. It is amazing mobile. Camera and Display is awesome. performance is stunning. Battery charge time is great. it takes aprox 35 minutes to full charge the battery from 0 to 100%. Over all it is a good phone. I did so much R&D before buying and I am fully satisfied with Nord2.
"It's a decent phone except for video call features. It could be for random users but the issue is prominent. The video freezes during video calls at random timelines and need to restart camera every time. It's very common in zoom calls and I see a blog on this issue highliting same issues with other video calling apps. One plus is aware of this issue but a little is done to solve this proactively. I had my camera hardware replaced and it became better but again with oxygen 12 update the issue started. So it could be mix of both hardware and software issues and now again I need to keep chasing them for resolution.Apart from above issues, the phone works well in terms of speed, battery life , UI etc.."
"The phone looks amazing and is light weight.Performance of the phone is as expected and very good for this price range.Display is very Rich,Battery life is good and the phone charges fast because of the warp charger.Camera is very good.I purchased this phone in the exchange of the old one, so all the features I am getting in this price range is above expectation & nothing to complain about"
"Since the very 1st week of the purchase of the phone I'm experiencing trouble with this phone, the phone suddenly restarts. Initially it used to happen once a day atleast in frount of me whilst I was using it, It might be restarting on its own even when the phone used to be idle. Now the phone restarts atleast 3-4 times a day. Completely un accepted performance from Nord2.I complained this to the customer care, they merely took note of it but I never got a call back from them, needless to mention, pathetic after sales service as well!!I want a new device or I'll see yaal in the Court of law!"
".Plz plz plz don't buy this phone. After using 1 month this phone . I only say one plus making fool . Before I use one plus 5 . Now using this phone. I never feel I am using one plus . I just feel I am using oppo. Or vivo phone. Google dailaer is very slow. Very slow refresh rate. Poor battery backup  Poor screen on off . There is hang problem. Phone excessive heat, One plus worst phone is this . If one plus giving same software of oppo vivo phone. Then why we buy 30000 rs. We just buy oppo vivo phone in 15-20 k . For the same function n quality.. the bad part of this very very slow. Phone. And very poor refresh rate"
"Such a worst phone. It does not deserve even for Rs. 10000. Very basic features doses not work properly this Rs 30000 phone. Iam repent on take this ghatia phone.1. On any video calls (whatsapp call, zoom call, Google, direct video call) your own video gets freezed.2. Time gets freezed on lock screen3. Youtube video gets hanged but audio keeps running4. Notification bar does not up post pulling it down. You woul need to lock and unlock the phone to fix it.Pathetic."
"The phone is okay but not great when u conoqre it with price vs value / performance.1. Battery drains faster at times and it doesn't last more than 12 hrs.2. Camera stopped in between and it hangs while shooting a video and didnt respond. I had to restart the phone allover again tonuse the can. Not expected at all.3. Volume and power keys are completely gone wrong. Such a bad placement. For every press of power key other side of your hand will touch the volume key, the placement of keys and ergonomics are completely inappropriate. It's almost 2-3 weeks still I need to be very careful.4. Plastic bakc/ body won't let you remove the cover anytime. You have to protect like a baby at this price this plastic back is not worth.These are most problematic things, other postives people have already told but the big issues are as above."
Phone look is premium.Camera - not that good for the price range of 30000Display - not as good as samsung amoled.Os/UI - Good and smooth( non laggy) but there's some issue like unable to find storage path for any andriod application.Unable to access various test with secret code. EtcBattery life - average (less than a day with average use)Phone gets reboot own it own .
"I really like the design, feature, specially the ambient mode.Cons : Battery Life ( Have to Charge 2 times a day atleast )Phone gets heat up really fast. Scared as already heard news of explosion.I was an One Plus 5T user for 3 years and I would prefer 5T even now over Nord 2."
"In screen Finger print reader is not good. You have to wake up the phone and then use the fingerprint reader. I guess the whole technology of in screen Finger print reader in all the brand's is not good.Battery life is super awesome, once my Nord 2 went on for 2 fulls days on a single charge. The 65 watt warp charger is wow, it changers your phone upto 90 % in just 20-25 mins.Camera is too good, I like it. I have personally found the images to be sharp and crisp. The front cam is decent too. I like the clear images from wide angle and depth sensor cam as well.In all very good camera and superb images on Nord 2 both front and back.To conclude, I would say, apart from the in screen Finger print reader being slow, Nord 2 is a really premium phone, it gives you that plush one plus premium feel and one should go for it.I got the green wood colour and plz note that green wood colour has a leather like finish at the back and the back is fiber based and not glass back.The other two color options of Blue Haze and Grey Sierra comes with Gorilla glass back."
"Battery is discharging too soon 40% in over night without any use, Front camera quality is not so good that i expect and phone is heating too much using multiple task for 20min may be any update can solve the issue or else it will be the big issue. And useless for investing 30k for this phone."
"Everything runs smooth thanks to Oxygens OS and 90hz refresh rate.Well, its impress me becoz, I have just upgraded from Galaxy J7 2016.So there is nothing about this phone that can't impress me.Played BGMI on this phone just to test. After lowering the graphics and increasing the frame rate, I got 58 fps which was quite disappointing from this 30,000 phone.However, I don't play much so it's perfectly fine with me.Till now it hasn't blasted. If anything happens then I am gonna upload the case on Social media.Overall good experience for me."
"Didn't find anything exceptional. Similar features are available in other phones for much less.Nothing great about the display, camera and processor speeds.Battery life and charging speeds are good though.Some annoying bugs like non responsive Google search tabs, no notifications after file downloads, difficulty typing into word documents etc are there."
1.Bettary drain essu2.ois hone ke bad bhi shakey picture3.night mode zero worked isse achha to 15-18k tak ke mobile de dete hai4.frant camera bilkul ghatia5.overall phone bilkul achha nhi lgaJitna paise popular krne m lgaye usse achha kuchh cheeje achhi de dete to achha hotaMujhe to lag rha dosto mere 30000 rupay bekar ho gaye bhae tum log ye glti n karo
Battery capacity is not good but fast charging maintains it. Zooming is not good. Phone heats too much. Sometimes it lags even back key doesn't work. Overall too costly phone as per specifications. 17000/- price would be enough. Overall don't purchase this mobile. Amazon is worst in delivery. After failure dates delivery was given after 10 days. Now within a month camera crashes during video call and your grievances will not be entertained by One Plus.
"This is my first OnePlus mobile. Before this I am a samsung member. But as I expect from OnePlus I get disappointed about software. Need so much update. I buy this mobile in first sale. As of now I notice these qualities in this mobile.Pros:-1. Charging speed ( full charging in 45min from 0 to 100)2. Performance is super fast (I am not a gamer)3. Speakers4. Screen looks cool5. InDisplay Finger print reader6. No heating issue, while charging as well as using time.Cons:-1. Selfie camera ( as a samsung member I feel disappointed about the camera even though they said it's 32mp but it's not perform like that)2. Charging drain little faster3. Clone app not working4. Music player missing5. Calling app ( I personally don't like it)6. And some widgets and cool features are missing like., Charging animation, clear cache, battery usage graph.This is my experience as of now. But it seems all cons are under software category. So we hope they can fix in next software update."

 It's good device but because of bugs in ui it's irrated sometimesCamera app is laggy and I have to swipe 4-5 time to close the app and some time on other apps also I have to swipe 4-5 timeGcam also lag and front camera preety averageStereo speaker is good but don't know in video call and phone speaker volume is low.Games work smoothly didn't faced any issues in gamingMain camera is good in outside but indoor its avg.Night mode photos are amazingDisplay is above avg not mind-blowing or nor badFinger print works fineCharging speed is amazing and battery life is also decent like other phones in this range It gives 7-8hrs SOT.Sometimes 4k HDR lag in youtube and on Netflix and Amazon prime HDR is missing.It's decent phone not mind blowing or nor badIf this bugs fixed than its amazing phone."
Camera vivo v21 se best hai charger bahut hi fast hai30 minute ke ander full charge ho jata haibattery very bad hai  use nhi hone par bhi drain hota hai heavy use karne par din me 2 bar charge karna padta hai over all sab battery ko chhodkar sab thik h👍👍
I've been using the device since last one month.Overall experience was pretty decent.Built quality is good front side and back side are made of glass. But frame is made of plastic.Finger print and facelock works smoothly.Lets talk about the camera of this deviceCamera is decent but the UI is not that good. Shutter speed is pretty smooth but camera quality is not good enough considering the specs and price point. It automatically applies beauty mode on the human subjects which is a major setback of this device i think. And the selfie shooter is also good in outdoor conditions but in low light it captures less details.Battery performance is quite impressive it lasts almost a day on heavy usage. Overall connectivity and if you ask me about the speed i would say I'm satisfied with the overall speed and performance.Dear one plus team please improve camera performance.
"Hi, the review is post 2 days of usage.Finger print sensor / face unlock are super quick. Camera both backa and front are good.Apart from these phone is just average, battery drains our rapidly (on 60hz / dark theme) it lasted just 9 hours with not much calling and heavy games.Sound of phone is reasonable.Out of 2 sims only sim1 is catching up 4g , sim2 does not get data connect at all (may be defect with my handset and shall be raising a ticket for the same)Not worth the price tag of INR 28k."
If you want a phone which should not lag in future after few updates then you should go for this phone. Other phones also come with dimensity 1200 chip but this one comes with clean os which improves your performance. Last but not the least its body... nowadays even 30k phone comes with plastic body.. this one looks premium than any other phone in this price range.. Good work one plus... I am not a fan of one plus phones.. but i liked this one.
Oneplus nord 2 blast. I am very scared
"Phone is overall great with good battery backup, ok camera but I found some issues like when I'm over the call and remove the phone from the ear the phone goes black i.e it's not locked yet i cannot operate it for few minutes. Also WhatsApp notifications doesn't clear sometimes and I need to clear one by one."
Body: Good buildScreen: very good viewing angles (no 4k)Camera: Average camera.. photos look more like oppo or vivo phonesSpeaker: Fine.. couldn've been way betterPerformance: laggy... The worst OnePlus i would've used.. can't expect anything else from mediatek..Don't waste your money on this
"Good phoneProcessor is obviously slow compared to flagship phones.Better to buy the 8,9 ones if you have money Those are the real OnePlus.These r the cheap ones in OnePlus category for kids that's where I bought it."
"Finally got this device after waiting for a week for its delivery from the day I ordered. I feel happy to use the device & its very snappy & responsive. The haptics adds more charm to this device not to mention the Charging Beast of 65 W that went 100% in maybe near to 30 mins. For the first time I charged. With my existing phone, it took 1:30 hrs to charge , so I was really impressed by its charging.Its just the first impression and I hope that this experience never changes and the device keeps on amazing me every day.Thank You Amazon & OnePlusMy only issue is that they should have released the Green Woods Variant for 8/128 Too for the similar price but don't worry, I will apply skins to this 😁"
I am very disappoint with this product. I am an old OnePlus user and a fan. Feeling bad to write bad things for OnePlus but had to.Why not to purchase:1. Extremely Heat machine with normal use sometimes. Crossing 45°c while playing game.2. A lot of small bugs are there like if the battery is below 15% and you try to connect cable of power bank phone will switch off.3. Finger print inable to identify many times.And many more are there....Why to purchase:1. Good camera quality2. Good performance3. Fast charging.4. Long battery life.Why I didn't like:Apart from the above negative reasons I face the charging problem. My charger stopped working fastly. That too the product is in warranty. Though there are many small bugs available even I don't want this product.
Overall the phone has a premier Look.battery charges really fast..However i find my speakers producing a zzzz noise  when the volume exeeds halfway.Its like something is blocking the sound and its not clean.Tried cleaning and restarting but its the same.I am not sure if its the issue with everyone or only me.However if the volume is lower than half which is also pretty Loud then i dont fine the speaker problem.
"Amazing phone.. Happy customer 😊Pros: 1. Beast charger (I charged 0 to 100% in 30min)2. improved camera (espacially rear). AI technology looks promising.3. Premium look. Feels like 50k phone in hand4. Stereo speakers are power-packed.5. Reformed Oxygen OS6. Backing OnePlus as brand7. Heptics are awesome8. Perfect screen size. (6.4 inch is ideal)Cons:.1. 120hz refresh rate is should have given.2. Sd memory card is missing.3. Front camera do not live up to expectations.4. Security issue(why camera is asking me to accept some random terms 😐)5. No wireless charging and waterproof rating.Overall it's a practical phone with premium look.""One plus's home coming""💫"
I really enjoyed taking selfie from it . It's camera quality is really good. Performance wise it is also  faster and fingerprint scanner and face unlock works so well. Also it get chardeg quickly in around 10 -15 min..and u can use it for a day with all the apps running in background and will not get any issues. Yes it also dicharged fast but you have got fast charging which would compensate the loss.Hope it helps❤️👍👍👍
I order OnePlus Nord2 almost it's been 2week I am using this phone as my experience is worst on this flagship ever.The issue I got as follows.1. Heating issues.2. Battery drain every fast on less usage.3. Lag problem as I order 12 ram veriant seriously guys. My old phone was 6gb ram compair with this that phone was running smoothly.4. When ever I got calls phone screen freezes and had to restart it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!GO FOR OTHER BARNDS I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED ON ONEPLUS PRODUCTS
Pros50mp camera capture good.Nice UI.In hand feel good despite heavy.Touch awesome.Batter charging time is 25min from 10 to 100.Audio with dual speaker is bestWiFi and network strength is very good.Cons:Heating issue requested for replacement also once.Wide angle camera is very poor.Heating issue majorly while using camera.90hz displayCamera not upto expectation
"• 100% Charge in 20mins! Runs the entire day after that.• Superb camera. Great clarity!• Premium Built quality• The speakers on this phone are real badass.• Smooth like butter at 8GB RAM!• Built in alexa, love this feature!• The viewing angles are greatIn 30k this is the best phone out there! 💯"
"I'm waiting this review , after purchasing 28 days.Here some point you have to keep in your mind before purchasing this product.1.The display of the phone is very nice and it's very smooth and refresh rate is just awesome.2.Camera quality is good but not worth of money.3.Superb charging Speed.4. Light weight and easy to handle.5.Overall battery performance is not so good and there is heating issue also."
"I have used this phone for quite a few months now. Here are my two cents what I feel is right and wrong with this phone.Pros-The look and feel of this phone is quite nice. It is not too heavy. The battery and turbo charging are heavenly. Camera quality is decent. For moderate to slightly heavy usage, i have never seen the phone lag even after all this time. The speakers are really nice.Cons-The biggest con I feel is the proximity sensor and heating of the phone during calls. The sensor momentarily turns on and off which is enough time for the hold or mute button to be pressed. I have observed another issue where the voice starts distorting in long calls. When I put the phone on speaker and put it back on call it goes away. I really feel sad when all these fancy features subside the basic functionality of a phone which is to make calls. The calculator app seems to be buggy since I cannot access the history. There is also some issue with Bluetooth earpods where they work for music and not for calls. This started happening after one of the updates and i am not sure how to fix it. Also, why on earth there is no jack for earphones - I really miss them with all of my heart.All in all it is a good phone but I use my device for calling a lot. And since that is an unpleasant experience many times, i would want to get rid of this phone in future soon. I would say definitely not worth the price. People have told me that samsung does a better job in this price range. Maybe I will try it next!God I miss the old Motorola phones..."
"The phone is excellent, but seeing two cases of battery burst, it makes you think that you are carrying a live bomb in your pocket.One plus should take notice and do some corrective action to remove fears from customers"
The phone has good configuration running smooth for normal use as of now. Wanted more groupings in the drawer menu may be with bars or something.But the sim tray at bottom with similar mic hole confuses with sim ejector. Also adding 2 sims with top and bottom is difficult.Look wise little less than premium.
"Finger print sometimes get stuck, however face recognition is really good. Battery life is good too and best part no need to wait for an hour or two to get it charged as the phone gets charged very fast. Some apps doesn't get open in one go and need to restart the app in that case. Overall the phone is good and smooth."
"I had earlier used xiaomi and realme phones only. Those phones were also good but the bad part was that after few updates bugs will be introduced in the system. System performance will not be same as it was before after few months. So mostly i had to get rid of phone after an year. So i decided to purchase first one plus nord and then nord 2 thinking that their software would be clean as they promise. So after using nord series for an year, i can say that their software team is same as Xiaomi realme. In every update system will get new bugs. Camera quality is average. So don't think that one should spend so much money on this either try other flagship phones or go to basics budget phone"
"This doesn't meet the expectations one plus has set in past.. I have used one plus 7 before and that phone still beats Nord 2 in every corner like camera, battery and sound. Battery charges very fast but drains too with pace which is not the case with one plus 7. Face unlock doesn't works most of the time. And lastly you need to give 100 kinds of different access permissions.After a months use found there are too much ads in this OS."

"Having used professional quality DSLR's for sometime now, I can say the night mode is insane on this phone, the portrait mode is also excellent. This phone just blows your mind with the camera quality. Overall seems like an excellent package at the price point. Highly recommended for anyone looking for flagship features under 30k. Oneplus has finally redeemed itself after some really sub par phones in the last 2 years."
"I have thought of having one plus brand phone and it was dream come true with one plus nord 2 release. i have used this phone  for almost 3 weeks and here is my opinion.I am a medium phone user, complete phone is superb. Camera is excellent. I loved the pics. Quick charging for 100% battery.Only 1 thing i observed was - battery life - maximum 1 day it comes for 1 charging with minimum usage.If oneplus quickly fixes it, it would be a wonderful phone.Thanks OnePlus, Thanks Amazon for quick delivery on the same day."
"Since we have detailed reviews available from many youtubers and buyers, I'll be sharing my observations after using around 5 days.1 - Super fast charging and that's wonderful. People will definitely miss fast charging if they are using ordinary charging.2 - Display is good however as usual like others. You will not get the feel like samsung or apple.3 - Camera is good not fabulous. Limited camera features available.4 - Mediatek processor is good so far no lag however it's too early to decide that.5 - There are heating issues like if you are browsing for more than 30 mins you will feel it (Not like burning train ). Personally I don't like it and 1+ has to fix it.Overall good budget phone and you can consider it."
"Battery life is average, Camera is Ok. Feeling after use is very good. But several instances of screen spot issue I saw when went to Service center. No warranty if any minor scratch even 1 cm on screen although not related to screen spot issue.Virtually impossible for any one after 6 months of usage that there will be no scratch. Seedhi baat hai warranty bhul jao aur asli kharcha to screen replacement me hi hai. 30000 me aur koi bhi phone le lo nhi to screen replacement me 8500 aur lagega. Even One plus 9R model, 70000 wali me bhi same problem tha usko bhi warranty nhi mila minor scratch ke karan jabki 3 months hi hue the use."
Being habitual but here are some updates over my last two weeks usage! Was skeptical about mediatek 1200 but overall perf is okay to me.Pros:- Good lightweight design - fit in one hand.- Fast charging- 0-100% in approx. 35 min- Rear camera is okay- NFCCons:- Heating issue in average usuage sometimes- Battery draining - should have been more optimized.- Lot of S/W glitches esp. with Microsoft apps..improved little bit after latest update.- No inbuilt bluetooth audio tuner - disabled!- Sometimes it feels slow opening apps.
If you are get the phone at 25000/- ... Value for money and charging + all round performance for daily life usage + regular functionable camera + optimization + display + design and built-quality are the best factorsCons ….. heat issue after 1hr bgmi gaming + in this range the camera 📷 features or regular equal to the Nord CE + hanging issues + mix of color os is worst move + control the power the of 1200 Diamond chip and provide minimum usage capability.Hope small issue will be clear by coming software updates...... Requesting plz bring 90hz in bgmi too 😄
"It is a great phone with flagship features. If you forget that it does not have a latest Snapdragon chip in it (does not make a difference to experience), you will just love the phone.Probably, the camera maybe slighly not up to the One Plus 9 Pro mark but is still better than One Plus previous series like 8. The selfie camera is even better than One Plus 9 phone.65 watt charging is just amazing - 29 minutes to full charge.. no more worrying about battery.."
"Looks is amazing, speed is good, charging happens in literally 10 mins. However not user friendly in many ways and has a lot of bugs. The flash light switches off automatically sometimes and it also switches off on pressing the lock button, if you have used one plus, then this is an odd feature. The ambient display doesn't have options of changing colour, they are predefined. Sometimes the alarm just keeps ringing after every 5 mins even when you switch it off, had to restart the phone. And alot of other bugs too, it hangs a couple of times. Have used 3 phones of one plus before this one, never was disappointed."
"1. Best fast charging , about 30 to 35 minut  to full charg 0 to 1002. Amoled display with 90 hz is best optimiz with O.S.3. Camera is one of the best.4. Without phone call, storage , photo, call , contact, location etc. Permission Maximum app not open it is not good5. Phone battery is discharged fast its also not good6. Mobile data consumption is very high I don't know why..??7. Custom settings is limited8. 3.5 mm jack is missing9. Clone app not worked properly10. Need to some updates.....This is my 3 day experience with oneplus Nord 2, a little disappointed with this phone"
"Review after 2 daysPros:1. Good performance. Smooth UI2. Good Front and rear camera3. Music is beyond the expectations. Its crystal clear. If you are music lover, go blindly4. Screen is good.5. Phone body looks premium6. Fast charging is superb. It charge within 30 minCons1. Battery is not good. It drain fast. But due to fast charging, you can bare it.2. Display should be 120hz. It still good3. Price is high. It should cheaper 4-5 k"
It has bugs.First impressionPros;-Charging 39 minutesGood displayGood speaker 🔊Mic quality is goodPremium desginOIS vedio stability is goodCons:- Fronte Camera needs very huge improvement.No macro camera even after paying 35k☹️Update after 6 months:-• Phone heats a lot When you use camera.• Now a days even after having 12gb of ram where as 6gb is pre occupied by the software 🙃.• Front Camera is worst in both day and night. 15k phone front camera performs better than this .
"After 7 days usage genuine feedbackVery fast battery drain like 2 years old phn,Auto call recorder not availableNot at all satisfied with phn under 30KNeed refund"
Worst and worst phone total 35k .waste no proper maintenance in one plus Nord 2 phones . I just used 1 days lots of issues raised from mobile even 10k cost redmi phone better than these phone please don't buy these phone. if u buy same situation coming to you also.main phone problem I have faced from Nord 2 mobile after usage of 1 day1)Not working power button2) Not working double tap lock3) even phone also not lock4) battery also drain only 1hr completelyMy sister brought for these phone for rakshabandhan gift for me but she also very disappointed even I tried return these phone but Amazon closed option 5days from the delivery date of the phone.
"Amazing product within a decent price range.With the first look, I have no complaints, all seems fine, MediaTek Dimensity Octa Core processor is great with the AMOLED Display.You get the premium feel once you hold the device. I have only one complaint about Amazon delivery, I had to fight with the support to get the delivery on time, the support openly said that I won't get the product on time and had to mail all the possible email IDs I had to get it delivered.This is the second time I have had the same experience of not getting the product delivered on time, so it says this is definitely not one of a scenario.Just to conclude Amazon has to step up on the delivery part & customer support and about the  OnePlus Nord 2 5G, it's worth the money you spend."
Only price high and brand name attract to people other wise nothing any special in this mobile. Such as MMX IN B JUST HATKE LIKE UNISOC PROCCER AND STOCK ANDROID .but I did not seen any information new in oneplus nord.I think better Indian Mobile micromax
"The phone has too many bugs and is almost useless at time.  The bugs are severe and cannot be ignored fir a 27k phones. Paytm,. Gpay, screen casting and quick acess buttons are deeply impacted.  The bugs go away when u restart the phone.  Hinting its due to software.I am somewhere outside cannot even return this phone.  This is day light robbery"
"Hi I am posting this review after using of 20 days of my use.Phone has below pros and cons#Pros :1. Awesome battery life and charge time2. Slim, Handy and light weight3. Back Camera setup is good and specially flash 📸 system is much better in this range phone#Cons:1. Lag in phone use2.

You just access gallery as plain photos recent.4. Sometimes WhatsApp videos are not saving in gallery.Overall phone is good in this price rangeAlternate suggestionGo for Oppo Reno 6"
You can buy better mobile with this budget. Camera doesn't feel like OnePlus - Poor quality (Front camera is the worst ever for a mobile with this budget). Only good thing is processor so Mobile doesn't lag or hangs up. Not worth for the price. Worst ever product from OnePlus. Speaker quality is worse.
"Front camera is very bad  i mean very bad, i think they should fixed this issue by update rest all good"
Using the phone for a week now. Feels very snappy and responsive especially when you shift  from samsung phones😂 I'm that kind of user who use the phone a lot for my work like checking mails and lots of calling and video meeting and documents reading writing. I also play pubg for 1hr on avg everyday and yet this phone makes me through 8am charging to next day 8am with 20 percent of juice remaining and also it is worth mentioning that this gets 20 to 100 during my bathing and breakfast period of 30 mins. BGMI goes smooth enough for me as like other tasks. About Camera I feel I expected better from youtube reviews but not getting that good results. Maybe need more time to explore the optics. Finally I'm a satisfied customer with this op device.
"After buy this phone i experienced that we should not buy any product after watching such paid or who is getting free devices from Oneplus and giving reviews.So, You will never feel like a Premium phone. Not at all. It's cost is under 30k and it seems OnePlus has taken devices from Oppo which is the same company for mid range market and they pasted OnePlus logo.. that'it.If you want same experience then go and buy Oppo mobile 20-25k range and you will get same or better experience..just you will see difference OnePlus logo vs Oppo logo. Not anything else. Really.Disappointed on this phone as it cost should not be more than 23k.Screen resolution is very low .. OnePlus Pro series is the best another all are worst quality.But Pro series they are providing too costly.If you are a fan of OnePlus logo then you should go for it else Resmi is also better option in this price range."
"Nord2 look and feel is very good, working has been good for first few hours.Camera is good as wellHowever 2nd day onwards, issues started popping up- App crashes frequent, happening with multiple app- No cloning- Unusual storage full warnings, despite it is just 20% use- Battery drains very fast, only respite is that it charges very very fast.- Needs a serious software refresh, not expected this experience with this range of phone"
"Bought this phone (12 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM, Android version 11, Oxygen OS) a month back, switching from an iPhone 6S. Here is some honest feedback after using it for a month. Especially for iPhone users planning to switch to it, think before you leap:𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘀1. The best feature of the phone is its super fast charging. It goes from 0 to 100% in 35 mins. I doubt too many other phones even come close. I ignore all else just due to this.1. The best feature of the phone is its super fast charging. It goes from 0 to 100% in 35 mins. I doubt too many other phones even come close. I ignore all else just due to this.2. The performance is good (as it ought to be with a 12 GB RAM), and works fine with multiple apps open. But honestly, I received the same kind of performance even with my iPhone 6S, bought in Oct 2015, which is mindblowing.𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀 - 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 - Not sure if these are Android issues or Oneplus flavour related1. Notifications: This is one of the major problems in the software - notifications just pop up and vanish on the switched off lockscreen, even if you try to click them.A) All apps download with notifications on by defaultB) You can't just click on a notification while it is on the lockscreen and open it. You have to click twice for some strange reason and then unlockC) If you are using your phone like a business phone, you have an app like Outlook on it. So even the Calendar notifications disappear, which is a major issue - there is no option to ""snooze"" it or ""dismiss"" it. You have to just remember that this sound means calendar notification and then go to Calendar app2. Face and Finger unlock - Face unlock is moody. Even though I have set it up for auto unlock, often it doesnt unlock and I have to use the finger unlock. Finger unlock is great but has a 5 to 10% failure rate, but only if you havent placed your finger in the perfect position.3. Calls: While a call is going on (while using a bluetooth device), the screen goes dark after some time, and if you hit the power button (because you need to access some other app) the call gets cut off. I realised this is a setting, changed it. The issue is still there though.4. Switching from iPhone to Android - real life nightmare. The Cloning software on the OnePlus is of no use. Only your contacts can be smoothly transitioned by making a vcf file from iCloud and uploading to your gmail account. Not so easy for iPhone calendar - better to switch all calendar entries to Outlook, and then open them on the Outlook calendar on the new phone. Forget about whatsapp messages transfer. There is no free app for this, I used a paid app from Wondershare, worked well, but lost all my broadcast groups. Ditto for sms messages, only paid apps available, I didnt even try.5. Screen brightness - the screen brightness auto adjusts to a low setting, even if you dont want it, and even if it isnt needed. Extremely annoying.6. Battery: The first few days, the battery lasted a whole day after charging. However, after a month of heavy usage, I think I am seeing a slight deterioration in battery life, and I need to charge in the evening once.7. Google assistant - inconsistent, not as smooth as Siri.8. Dictionary shortcuts - I used them in iPhone, such as tbr for Thanks and best regards. But on this phone, I have set them up, but after one or two days they stopped working for some strange reason, and still not working.9. Photo gallery app doesnt even have a facility to add Favourites.Whew, these are the ones I could recall. Net, net, I would strongly recommend that iPhone users stay with iPhone and ditto for Android. The change is extremely stressful, and the stress doesnt reduce much with time."
"This is my first Oneplus device. Maybe I may not give accurate review as other OnePlus users. But this phone has lived up to his expectations. In terms of Camera, UI (Heard that Color Os has been merged in this but still a new user so didn't know much of a difference) , Performance , Hardware smoothness amd everything. The only thing that it has not good at its the battery life. It drains pretty fast untill and unless you put it on Battery saving mode. Which wil last long till 1 and half day. Even though I used data net and used hotspot on this device still it last for a day and half so it's good but only when put on to the battery saving mode. Otherwise Nope. Overall it's good phone with everything you could've asked for. But not the battery life though"
"Reviewing after two weeks of usage👍Talking about build quality and feel in hand...it's Good!👍Camera and photo quality...it's Good! Night time for also good.👍Charging and Battery backup...charges superquick and backup reasonably last for 15 to 18 hours in normal usage.👎Mainly disappointed with screen quality as it's not as crisp as I was expecting it to be. It's not bad though but I was expecting more.Note: Case that comes free in the box with phone is of really good quality, loved it!"
"I would prefer this mobile phone to those who are not a heavy gamer or user. Main feature of this mobile is its charging speed, it gets charged in approx 38 min (0-100%) which is very fast and it gives a one day of battery back up if you use it normally. It won't give you 2-3 hours of nonstop gaming, if you are a gamer or heavy user then you have to charge it for two times a day, but bcz of its charging technology the battery back up doesn't even matter to me. I play bgmi and the mobile performance is very good. If you are looking for a all in one mobile phone under 30k then this is the one for you. You will see many negative reviews of this mobile but I loved this very mobile much. And mainly it's UI is very clean 👍."
I waited for green wood colour and I am really happy that I did. Green colour looks stunning with that leathery back. Battery backup not bad since I'm not a gamer. Camera impressive lots of options. Only issue I found is that display is not very bright and HDR not supported on Netflix.
"It's a near to perfect phone if you use it like 90% of the people would use on daily basis. 90hz display is just a cherry on top. Charges extremely quickly and lasts more than a day even if you use it more than your normal usage on day to day basis. Camera quality could be better but i have no complains as it does the job fairly well compared to it's competitors. It's better than Mi11x if anyone's looking for that, so just go for it."
"One plus has to keep it's quality best. But they failed to do it with this phone. My gorilla glass started unsticking from one side. Rest also not up to the mark. Previously I was having 1+3t, it was a nice phone but this phone does not satisfied me."

"Degrading experience for me with the phone and the customer care.Exaclty after the a week that I  got the phone , the screen started getting distorted as attached in the picture.Contacted the oneplus customer care reagarding the same , and they suggested to take  the phone to a service centre for their Engineer to check.Really ? For a phone  that is 8 days old  is that the resolution for this kind of an issue ??I am disappointed with my first one plus experience"
Good device in this price range with very good camera n smooth experience n display is brilliant. Only negative things i found are1. Battery life is so so not that bad though but not that good either. Only positive thing is phone is charged fully in half an hour2. Netflix is not in HDR though phone supports that. I hope further updates solve this issue soon
"My first OnePlus phone and it is great in every department, no complains except for battery life, even on average use its doesn't last me a day (I mostly use insta, reddit and WhatsApp. Occasionally YouTube and streaming apps) I was using Redmi phone before this and that one even under heavy use lasted my 1 and half day. Fast charging is excellent but battery also drains as fast as charging."
"Due to overheating issue I had returned the phone,It's been over a month now I haven't got the refund,As well as everytime customer executive false commitment, I have pissed off allof this. There's a return refund policy of 2-3 days today it's been over a month now.Now I am going to take legal action against you guys."
"Nord 2 excellent phone . But buy if you can avail offer and get it on at a price around 26k or 25k. I won't recommend it buying at 30k. If you are purchasing it around 30k than go fir iqoo7. This is an excellent upgrade in all aspects from nord1. Good fast charging, haptics are awsm, durability is good. Performance is also good but if you are heavy gamer than go for poco gt. But in all around aspects go for Nord 2"
"I am a fan of OnePlus, I have been using multiple OnePlus phones from last 6-7 years, but this phone is waste of money. It has sensor issues, it has heating issue, battery life is worst. When you charge the phone almost boils, if you scroll using your fingers, sometimes display becomes un responsiveI think these are enough not buy this phone. May be another software update can help to minimize these problems but this is my guess only. Moreover, Amazon not providing return policy for this phone, they should have considering this phone has somany issues.Do not go for this phone, you can go for other OnePlus phones."
This one plus Nord 2 is really worth the money. If u are a type of gamer u should go for it. And the speaker are amazing. The camera is awesome but not better than samsung. This mobile is very slim and easy to use. Only I don't like one thing in this that is the update. It is become 6 months for me that I bought this phone but till now I dident get the Android 12 update. And I have samsung A51 which is a more older model and it has got the update. But if u see this Mobile is overall good only be careful of the update
"Early i was using miui in redmi 7 pro and exchanged that to get one plus nord 2.Design is owsome.In hand feel is premium.Its budget premium phone under 30k.Camera is good enough.Battery backup is one day around in normal usage.Charging is out of the box, veryyy fast charging speed.Oxygen os is superbb .Cons- handfree call feel low sound even in full volume"
"इससे बेहूदा सेल्फी हो ही नहीं सकता वह भी 32mp का क्या मजाक बना रखा है? इससे अच्छा तो प्लास्टिक का खिलौना होता है😡I received it on 30 Jan 2022.  Today I am sharing my experience after 26 days.  I am 70 percent happy with this set.  30% drawback of this set:- Battery drains very fast.  Even though I am not a gamer at all, I am still plagued by the lack of battery backup.  Since I am the media in-charge of Hindu Yuva Vahini, due to this I have to spend more time on Twitter and Facebook.  Both these apps give a backup of only 3 hours on continuous use, sometimes if the video or photography has to be done more then the battery gets exhausted in just 2 to 2:30 hours.  OxygenOS version 11 is the only in this set, at least it should have updated VERSION 12 by now which is the biggest demerit.  There is also no auto call recording facility.  If you want to record someone's call, then its Google dialer app will make noise and tell the next that the call is being recorded which is a very big problem, this deficiency should be updated and removed so that all the calls will auto record.  This can be done and the next one is alerted that your call is being recorded, it should be completely stopped.  Camera quality is very very poor. I am completely satisfied with other things."
Camera performance is inconsistent... battery  drains too fast.. heating issue while charging.. not happy with the 65 watt charger.. they could have given less watt charger but battery performance  could have been increased ... with this availability  issue  I have bought  this blue haze color which is not at all looking good...Display  is superb..Charging time is very less..
"I'm writing this review almost after 1 year of use and I'm sure that this is one of the best value for money product. It hasn't disappointed me at any point of time be it's battery, charging, camera or performance. I was in dilemma when I had bought this, but now I'm  Totally Satisfied with this product."
"Hello people, this is my 1st oneplus mobile, and this is awesome mobile with great features and best thing is this it has now updated with new things that are very good as compare to other oneplus mobiles, like more 5g band support, better camera features, screen refresh rate..... and many more...Till now after 5 days of usage phone is good and very premium, hope it works well in future too.............................................................................................."
"The device is an allrounder, it ticks all the boxes like :-1) the design is just the best it is premium in touch and feel and attractive as well.2) the cameras are breath of fresh air as it comes with a best in range actual 50mp main camera and above average to good ultrawide camera. In the video you get OIS some oppo features like Bokeh video, dual video mode, Bokeh flare, etc.3) performance is good, first time the company has used a mediatek chipset hence it is not yet fully optimised but it will get it in a month.4) the battery life is also good or say great, lasts a complete day and some more in the next day and as it comes with 65W charging it needs just half an hour to go from 0 -100%.5) the software is still oxygen os but withe few twists the camera app is from OPPO now the settings is redesigned to look more cleaner and more reale ui-ish but still nothing to complain about, except it is forcing in 1-2 features to agree with the t&c and privacy policy.6) the haptics are flagship grade speakers are stereo and are accurate mic is also providing good output.7)  RIP HEADPHONE JACK!! 🤯😱😔🥺🤣"
"Model: 12GB RAM, 256 GB Storage.Camera: Excellent Night mode (see details in Living room Image clicked when hardly any object in room is visible). Wonderful color corrections by AI. Image quality is amazing & colors capured are extremely close to visual scene.Storage: Faster read and write speed.CPU & GPU: Minor glitch while playing 4K video on YouTube. Gaming performance is wonderful.Fingerprint sensor: Sometimes, False positives are there for non-registered fingers with similar fingerprint pattern. Strict matching is required here.Face Unlock: It is very quick.Heptics: Wonderful experience of Haptic feedback.Screen: Vivid colors with wide viewing angle and 90Hz display seems ok for general use but for Arcade gaming its not up to the mark. Pixel density is just right for realistic image experience.Video Enhancement: It is wonderful features while you are video streaming on network data.Inbuilt Zen Mode feature: I would recommend this for every working professional.Review written after 35 days of Handset usage."
"The product is overpriced as what it offers. The phone gets restarted multiple times and gets heated. Also, camera quality is ok. I doubt whether product delivered was true and genuine quality and not a refurbished one or first copy kinda. Not value for money. Please dont but the phone. 😢😢😢"
"This is my genuine review. Phone is useless. I bought it on 30 th November. Major issues are I have to get out of my home for getting a clear voice because all the calls are blurred coz of low network capturing ability. I used all my previous phones without any issue and network support is strong here.Secondly whenever we hold the phone to answer any calls and keeps near our face, it either gets hold , on loud speaker or on mute. Low quality sensor.Battery is a major problem. Even though it charges fast , it drains out too in fast mode. With my minimal usage I have to charge phone two or two and a half times a day.About amazon- I have raised they complaints b4 my return period and till now no one turned back for inspection. Inspection dates keeps on getting postponed.Better to avoid this one. I used One plus 3T, One plus 7 and One plus watch. I have never faced any issues with those products.But this is very cheap quality one"
Writing this after a month use. Gotta say camera quality is awesome. But front camera isn't that good just okiesg. Overall phone perform very well. Green wood color is amazing.
"Yes, I liked the phone. I'm writing this review after using a phone for a week. I got it at ₹27,000. Gray Sierra is just amazing. Fast Charging is also an awesome feature. Should have dual app feature for all apps. All is well but Camera quality is not upto the mark & Biggest Disappointment is that No 3.5 mm jack. But I'm happy with the Deal.P.S : I hope it will support to all 5G bands 😜"
Very comfortable phone to hold ..stylish ..Speaker sound while watching YouTube is very loud and clear ..Good software experience..UI is just great ... don't mix color OS with Oxygen OS ..that's my simple suggestion to oneplusOtherwise  phone is simply great
I purchased and used last 2 months. I saw that after 2 months only this product start hanging though 8 gb ram is there. And while charging in battery or you will talk in phone you can feel heat in the phone. So heat issue is also there.  Camera quality is good. Batter life is only one day while using all features of internet.
"It's been almost 10 days using this phone and I upgraded from Huawei but felt no regret. OnePlus was always been a step back in camera department but 1+ fulfilled it with this phone. If I talk about why you should buy this phone so there are many reason like if I talk about processor, display (won't feel slow if you comes from 60hz or even 90hz), battery, charging, camera performance, build quality and compaction; Nord 2 plays well.Things that makes a better user experience:Its premium hapticsIts Oxygen OS (coded with color os but still not a deal breaker)Its well optimised 90hz displayIts premium in hand feelIts smoothnessIts bunch of featuresIf you're paying little extra as per Dimensity 1200 so what you're getting an overall pack and its flagship feels then it's worth paying. Go undoubtedly, won't get regretted that's for sure.I hope, it helps you guys to make decision better for your precious bucks."
"Got Scared about Blast of Battery News and One plus didn't reply them.UI and Bugs, Need and Solid Update.Don't buy until one-plus team officially make statement about blast and return or refund all the customer who bought nord 2"
I have been using this phone for more than 2 months.First time I choose one plus because of it's brand name....but finally disappointed.-The phone battery drains very fast....and --front camera not up to mark- Major Heating issues in October and in indoor it heats like a cup of a hot tea.Please Don't waste your valuable money on such phone. It's not worth it even under 20k.Don't go with the brand name...after using this phone it feels like we're using an oppo phone.There is nothing to give 30k to this garbage.
"Well to start with, i wouldn't say its a great one but yes definitely it is a good phone. It meets my requirements. Camera yet to test.Battery life could have been to improved. Charging time is very nice, fast charging.Finger print sensor works good, no lag noticed so far.90Hz AMOLED display, no major difference noticed compared to 120Hz unless you keep two phones side by side to compare.Screen brightness could have been improved.Sound quality is good.Overall satisfied with this device, meets my requirements and expectations."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I wish to inform I am happy with oneplus Nord 2. Got it at ₹22kPros:Smooth Amoled 90hz display, it's really smooth.Dimensity 1200+ ufs 3.1 great speedFast charging is the best in segmentLove for oxygen OSBest camera in segment.Battery life is around 5-6 hrs on screen time and a 1.5 days for normal user.Design is awesome with glass backLight weight 189gm, and handy phoneIn the box wrap charge 65 and a premium back case.Cons:Few bugs can be seen in oxygen os however not the major oneHeadphone jack missing"
"This phone is perfect in all sense.One plus finally arrived in Sub Flagship version of it.Pros:-1) Camera is awesome, colour concentration, clarity, pixel binding is bingo, OIS is superb. Front camera is awesome. Night mode is not disappointing. Camera 4.5/52) Display is superb- Amoled display is superb, 90hertz and 60 hertz diplay awesome is there. DC DIMMING IS NOT PROVIDED, but it's okay. Display--5/53) Sound quality is good. Sound-- 5/54) Battery- backup is decent. 4500 mAh is enough for day today work. Battery- 5/5WARP CHARGER 65W is superb. It's in the box. WOW just wow.This phone is great. 29999 is worth it."
"Camera quality is like 13 mp camera. No clarity  in shots. Resolution is very bad too much grain ..Face unlock so fast that works on mask also 😂Camera not working well it says. Sd card error ; while there is no sd card slotBattery charges in 40 mins but drains in 8hrs without heavy usageApps not running all closes automatically after some seconds as u open it.Pubg after showing logo closes automatically amazon, flipkart, Gallery,. Camera also closes automatically and ur click does not saves  almost all apps have problems...  I have contacted oneplus the said to clear cache i have done that also.  Too much bugs in phone..Sound is not realistic ,Camera is very bad not worthy for 30k  no smoothness in photos"
Being one plus fan I won't write anything bad but will try to make a unbiased review.  As promised battery life and 65 warp charge meet the expectations. Fantastic phone truly flagship breaker. One complaint as I am one of one plus user since long the camera quality has become more like oppo. The premium quality of OnePlus seems missing while using camera.rest all is worth the price.
"Reviewing after 2 days of usage.Ordered my first one plus phone on 30th July and got it on 1st of August 2021 :)Thanks amazon for quick and safe delivery.Back cover will be included in box along with charger.Touch is very smooth, Back Camera is very good, front camera is ok. Battery charges quickly and battery backup will be one day (i will not play games).you can not plug headset."
"If you want a good phone under a reasonable budget,go for this.Battery life is pretty good. If you're out for 6-7 hours with a full charge, using mobile data & other stuffs in medium frequency , remaining charge will be 60-50%. Charging speed is fantastic, from 40 to 100 it just takes 20 mins.Camera is of superb quality, make sure to use the settings & beauty mode as per requirement.Storage is more than enough.You won't need an external SD card for this.You need to get a wireless earphone since wired ones aren't applicable for this. Apart from this Speaker is pretty good.I'm using this for few weeks & quite satisfied with the performance. So if you're planning for a buy, just blindly trust this."
"I am writing this review after using it for 10 months. Please do not take this phone by mistake.Because in such a short time, this phone has started hanging. Just after calling someone, the screen is turned off and after that no matter how hard you try, its screen does not turn on until the phone is disconnected from the receiver.And the second major problem is that the side button which is used to mute the phone to general mode has stopped working.All my money wasted I don't know what to do with this junk"
"This product is worst. Only buy it if you want to throw your money and do not want any return. After 1 week of usage it started to shut off automatically and continues to do so. After giving it to service center i got it after 25 days and still no change was done by the service center. Now I am again giving it to service center for repair. Please do not buy this, go for any other phone but not this one, trust me you'll regret it."
"very bad product i am very disappointed only i am dial call and receive call this mobile battery drain 50% within 5 to 6 hours, also on video call every time video is off only audio call is running one plus please check this variant and amazon please refund my moneyअमेज़न और सेलर दोनो ही कॉस्टमेर को बेवकुफ बनते हैं मेरे पास एक ही फोन था जोकी मैंने एक्सचेंज करके वनप्लस नॉर्ड 2 मोबाइल खरीदा था जिस्म बैटरी की समस्या निकली तो मैंने रिटर्न कर दिया और अभी भी मेरे पास फोन नहीं है मुझे बहुत ज्यादा और आर्थिक रूप से से हानी पाहुची है मुझे अमेज़न से क्षतिपूर्ति चाहिए"
"Doesn't matter how good the phone is, without good battery life, it is nothing. You hardly get 3.5 hours of screen on time with screen set to 90Hz and Always on displayMy brother's Galaxy A52 with similar display and exact battery capacity givs 1.5 days of battery life with medium usage and atleast 1 day of battery life with heavy usage. I raised this issue with OnePlus, but they did not fix it yet. If you are a person who hates charing phone several times a day, then this phone is not for you"
"Nothing seems to function properly, the operating system is a big bundle of bugs even after updates, the colour os merger has created a plethora of problems, will not purchase any one plus phone ever again!!"
"1. Very , very and very bad front camera. Not at all 32MP performance. My old Redmi Note 5 Pro was better than this shit.2.There is no special LED light for notification. It is only horizontal flash.3.If you use 'app-lock' setting , you will not get any messege content in notification bar. i.e- whatsapp.4.Battery drains too fast. You have to charge minimum 10 times in a day.5.Inbuilt 'File manager' is the worst decorated app.6.There is no classification in messege section.7.The handset has heating issues. The charger gets heat like a pocket bomb.8.You can't use no double app except FB & Whatsapp.9.If you record a call, other side will be able to know.That's a problem in a serious condition (threat etc.).10.You can't use the 2-megapixel MACRO sensor. It's like a fake feature.11.The instagram or any web application image quality is very low. Same with the youtube.12.Scrolling is automatcally occurring downwards on youtube when you hold finger.13. When I am using wifi (VoWiFi) other side of the line cannot hear me and I am not able to hear other side during voice call.N.B-Amazon delivery guy was very good."
I dislike product because there is lack of many programs such as there no auto call recorder for saved numbers and for unknown numbers it speaks loudly that your call is being recorded.Selfie camera is not good as per the expected 32 megapixel camera. File manager is not in a proper way so that you could find your send or receive files on telegram and WhatsApp app. As I am first time user I am unhappy with performance till now after 10 days of use. Though I can replace my mobile within the period but I was checking it so that in future I should buy updated version of oneplus or not.My e-mail address is -knt1.goodboy@gmail.com
Firstly I heard a lot about OnePlus and even used OnePlus 6t which was fab.But after buying with 24hrs of use I feel it's s wasteBattery gets drained 50% within 2-4 hrs without using any gaming app or entertainment appsFingerprint reader doesn't detect easily which is very frustratingCompletely disappointed
I have searched and reviewed many phone before going for this one. I personally need allrounder phone which will be reliable and do most of function as good output. After using for more than 8 days i am posting this review. Rear Camera is good upgrade even in low light and home condition.Front camera is pretty ordinary even though it upgrade to 32 megapixel. I have previous nord phone which give more clear and sharp selfies / video than this one. Oneplus need to upgrade or sort this issue in future software update.Overall oxygen OS merger seen with Color OS in few area like camera and battery saver mode which is ok but biggest concern is privacy policy acceptance for each setting and app. One OTP update took place in Chinese language which is very annoying. Day today life usage of phone is excellent (network and carrier aggregation). 90 Hz refresh rate is also feels good not a big difference. Battery life is excellent as i am not game additected person. My office apps and windows working apps are doing great on this phone  which is really helping in this WFH situation.One plus shall have metal frame instead of plastic which looks very ordinary compare with other low budget phone which already have aluminum or metal frame. I will say overall phone is great in this price range.People who have worry for buying IQ007 phone shall definitely go for this one
"Cons :1) camera lens are right side  and your index fingure will be on it while holding the phone.2) OS is color OS of Oppo,3) some of the button function very hard to operate4) the phone is size is big and weightProns:1) camera quality is good2) battery life and charging very fast3) Phone Performance is goodWhat big draw back is camera position on the handset."
"Given this feedback after 6 months of use. Overall phone is good like Camera, screen, battery but I start facing lagging and slowness issues once it's reach to 90 GB of storage (out of 128 GB). Sometime all applications automatically got crashed and sometime I need to restart my mobile to use it again. Not expecting this type of phone from OnePlus. Seems they launched without proper testing and plan to do so on our money. Regretting my decision to choose OnePlus over Samsung."
"HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED TO BUY FROM AMAZONReceived damaged product. SCREEN PIXEL IS BROKENAs I received this phone, immediately raised complaint to Amazon and they are not refusing to replace or return this defective item as per Amazon worst policy and also because of Seller do not want to receive return or replacement request due to ONEPLUS COMPANY POLICY.Now SELLER, AMAZON and ONEPLUS is suggesting me to go for repair at ONEPLUS service center to get this fixed.HENCE DON'T BUY THIS PHONE SPECIALLY FROM AMAZON."
Camera quality not good and hanging most of the time.
"Fingerprint reader and cameras are excellent. Battery life is a bit low as compared to the competitors but the 65 watt charging compensates for that( i.e, 0-100% in just 30 minutes) . I was not able to find Carrier aggregation (eg :4G+) in this device but in all other aspects including the oxygen+color OS is a perfect combination which I personally like as all the cool camera features(Bokeh flare) of oppo phones can be found in this device. I personally like those features. No headphone jack but it's ok as every single company is following 'the apple way'."
"I was confused about this purchase.. but things end up awesome. Using this device for 3rd day.HighlightsThe main camera is amazing, especially the night mode.Selfie camera is awesome in outdoorsCharges really fastSmooth oxygen OS experience.GamingBGMI >>> played for 1.5hrs continuouslySettings in smooth>>extreme.No lags and all in gaming session.Mobile gets just warm(most common)Cons:Need improvement in front camera (indoor condition)Should provide usb type c to 3.5mm jack converter.(previously they used to provide)"
"After buying the phone I tried to set up the phone by adding Google account , it ask us to restore the previous settings and I did, after 1 month if usage, amby issues statrted to arise ( Eg: 1. if you try to attach an item in Gmail after writing the body , the content automatically gets deleted. 2. if you try to upload any documents in the website, it says due to insufficient internal memory, process cannot be done.3. Now if you try to report these bugs using the logkit in one plus community, theere are different sections of phone categorized for each bug, this actually crash when tou try to touch on any of the icon.)Only way to reslove the issue was to format your phone, and i did it. Again Setup the account, this time I ddnr restore all the settings from Google , but did some of them as manual, and the phone started to work properly ( the above mentioned issues were not present now). 2 months after this , these issues are again started to come. If I need to format the phone every 2 months , how can a user buy a phone worth 30k and use peacefully.I feel cheated. Please don't buy"

 Sometimes While incoming call screen open and shut...I don't no why this happening even updated then also in 10 calls 3 to 4 times happen"
"I am a big fan of stock android experience. I previously had One plus 6 with Oxygen OS that had near stock experience.  Specs and everything is really good in this phone. For someone who doesn't care about the UI/UX, its a great phone. But for me its disappointing to see One plus merging the ColorOS and Oxygen OS. Until now I used to bracket One plus in the Google Pixel basket. With this purchase, it just moved to Mi, Oppo, Vivo basket, the basket that has phones with UI that tries too much and fails or are buggy. I was a loyal one plus customer, but my next phone won't be one plus."
"No lagging in phone. It's my second OnePlus phone.First phone was OnePlus 5T which was purchased on 7 Dec 2017. Till date it's running fine. Now I am using Nord 2.I must say that don't believe on negative feedback. Those who are giving 1,2 or 3 rating must use any other phone in same range like VIVO 23 or VIVO 23 pro, OPPO F 19 pro, Or Samsung SF 20 and further compare that. Every phone have some little bit issue. Some phone have good camera, Some phone have good sound quality, some phone have good display quality similarly different people have different mindset. Now coming to feedback on NORD 21. Audio - 5 / 5 ( Stereo Output)2. Display - 5 / 53. Battery - 4.5 / 5 ( Little bit heating problem and drain fastly)4. Back Camera - 4.5 / 55. Front Camera - 3.5 / 56. Design - 4 / 5"

 I had purchased a OnePlus Nord 2 set in January 20 it Was mentioned there that it is gorilla glass display even I had applied a tempered glass from outside on it but today what happened I was just putting my phone in the pocket and it falls down on floor I think its only 1 to 2 feet the display is broken from inside and the screen is damaged now, I had contacted to customer care they are saying it's not covered in warranty ok I can understand it, but what about the gorilla glass I had another phone they are falls maybe many times but never face such issues. These is a manufacturing effect and now I have to spend atleast 9k on it to get it repaired also the service charges. So my question is that why you saying gorilla glass the screen is of third quality worst worst phone ever OnePlus is totally disappointed me. It's an fraud to a customer I am going to escalate this issue and file a legal complaint against you.#onepluscheaters#oneplusbannedinindia"
"The product one plus Nord 2 is decent I would say. Past from 3 months I'm using this device, the major pros are1. Call quality2. Dual speakers3. Back camera4. Clean UI and interface5. Regular software updates.6. Battery life is decent7. Looks premium in hand8. Alert slider is there.Let's move to the cons :1. Front camera is not up to the mark (even my MI note 5pro is giving better selfie experience)2. No 3.5mm head phone jack.3. Few bugs related to software (hope it will be resolved in further updates)4. Initially while booting the phone, I felt warmth near the back camera portion. Eventually I got settled after sometime.Verdict : it's a very good device so far in oneplus Nord series. I felt happy if they might have provided earphones within the box especially in this price range. Justified the name flagship even though it got huge competition while releasing this product."
"The phone is typical oneplus, ad-fre and seamless experience. Overall good build quality and feel after 2 weeks of usage. One thing I've noticed is that the phone goes horrendously slow of you try adding any cracked or non play store apps. And battery life is average, nothing great as I get nearly 20hrs of phone life with full 4G usage through out the day."
"Just to let anyone know looking to buy this this phone is not a gaming phone and so by default it run in balanced profile (new feature implemented by OnePlus for nord 2 only)still all apps and medium games run without a problem like premium but for heavy gaming you need ro enable high performance mode from settings (one plus usually does not do this different profile thing so people miss on this)but this increases battery consumption and heats the phone a lot so i will not recommend it , you can play cod or pubg at med-high  without fps drop but for ultra high settings or games like genshin impact (if 60 fps enabled) or fortnite you will need to use performance to play them on deceny to high graphic .The camera is probably one of the best at the price eith the best night mode at this range , it did have the overprocesing hrd but there was an update on the second day which did tune it down somewhat but without HRD everything is still good.Everything else is good as expected (good speaker , no bloatware,etc)"
"Using it fo more than a month.Pros:-1. Camera is good2. Batter life good3. Charging speed is very very good.4. Size and build quality is very good.5. No bloatware.6. Stereo speakers are amazing.Cons:-1. Fingerprint sensor is poor. Can be unlocked even from other's fingers. Very poor.2. Display flicker sometimes.3. Unstable updates released, so I have not tried installing available updates."
"We write This review after 20 days use .this is very good phone and  0 to 100 per charge it takes massive 25 minutes .  after they are full charge mobile is heated and  battery backup very average if we use 20 hrs regular only 10 hours battery backup provide me. If charging is fast then battery reduced very fast . Camera , mobile space , very goodFinally conclude that mobile is depend on battery backup"
"The phone is good, switched from Pixel 2, so the experience is not that clean, but overall its not bad. Recommended for normal day to day usage, for gamers I believe better options are available.There are goods and bads, good main camera, okayish ultrawide and selfie cam (I don't use them much anyway). GCam does good job with selfie cam insted.There are few software bugs (feeling like beta version of Android which I used to get on Pixel devices) which are quite annoying and I am hoping it would be fixed soon.One is issue with Bluetooth earphone for prolonged calls, there is some jitter during calls only.. music works absolutely fine.Also while taking on Bluetooth, sceen keeps turning on sometimes even when phone is not touched (probably proximity sensor is still working) which should not be the case.Didn't like the launcher much, I reverted to Microsoft launcher which is clean and really good, almost as good as Pixel launcher with additional features.Battery I would say is enough for a day even with lot of calls, around 30-40 min gaming, 3-4 hr browsing or music I get at least 30% remaining (SOT-5 hrs, calls 2-3 hrs). I do use 60Hz screen though, but I guess even with 90 Hz charging or once would be sufficient."
The product's main attraction is its camera. The camera is average. Don't expect much. Also the video mode always hunts to focus even in between video making the video look very bad. Also the camera cuts the sides and crops the image in both camera and Video. The wide angle lense and the monochrome lense is a waste bin. Only good thing about this phone is its fast charging and sound quality
"Pros: screen, connectivity (both Wi-Fi and cellular), charging speed, looks (except the blue one), gaming performance,The main camera with OIS is great but when combined with the the other cameras the overall camera system is ok.Cons: battery life is a little less than expectedAlso there is news about this phone exploding ....so for now I leave it far away when I go to sleep😑😑"
"It's a very negative point of this hand set that the ear phone options is missing. Every one can't use Bluetooth ear phone. I don't like this phone. The company should addon this feature every hand set.Another issue is call recorder. It should be give the one side alert. Because sometimes it's need to record for self benefit.So, I hate this feature of phone set.Even the iPhone has to these option. May I know is it(one plus) big brand than iPhone?"
"Truly after years One plus has returned with its flagship Killer title. I'll be baised and tell few points I noted while using it-*Beautiful design*Screen is amoled and it's 90hz but it could have been 120 but yes battery would have drianed faster so 90 hz is okay for me.*Excellent ram management with 12 gb ram I get 8 gb free which is really good. OxygenOS has really been optimised even though the code has been implemented with colorOS*Most amazing Primary camera, the sony imx766 sensor is truly an amazing masterpiece daylight and night time photos are flagship level. Ultra wide could have been 16mp as it is kinda okayish with 8 mp lacks details. And 2mp useless camera. Says it maintains Bokeh to be honest just to give a 3 camera it's included. You will be satisfied with the main camera only won't need anything else. Selfie 32 mp is also a sony imx 615 sensor does good job both in day an night conditions but sometimes in critical conditions of lighting lacks details.*Dimensity 1200 AI truly mediatek has got into the market with it. Antutu scores beat most flagship Snapdragon processors it's truly powerfull and snappy to use no lag on day to day tasks and gaming is perfect in this. BGMI max all settings 45 FPS avg. Smooth extreme 60 fps. Excellent job but realme x7 max has same processor which gives smooth 90fps option. Maybe an update while bring it so.*No heating issues whatsoever, using it for gaming and all other stuff for hours and also photography still temp seems not exceed 45 degrees.*Battery efficient?? There has been rumours battery is draining fast. I would like to suggest all every phone will drain fast even 5000mah battery ones too if all the sensors all the extra features all kinds of unnecessary things are turned on. You have to keep few disabled and necessary things enabled and it will and it has been lasting for me for one day (check YouTube for Nord 2 battery saving tips and tricks) and with its wrap charge 30 mins full charge which is crazy fast.*No audio jack, alert slider is there (saved) dual speakers, support for HDR±, 6 5G bands (thank you OnePlus for not giving 2 bands) both sides gorilla glass 5 and pretty much everything you could ask for."
"The overall product is good. However, if you're are true OnePlus fan who has been using OnePlus device then those will be little bit disappointed. As this phone have really very serious issues with the permission. You need give almost every permission in order to use feature such as camera, search and for other applications. Another thing which really disappoint me is the OS. Now, it's more like color-oxygen OS. Which is disappointing."
"I have bought 3 nord 2 5g phones, all I have tested with different brands Bluetooth1. Screen casting stops working when using Bluetooth.2. Playing online games like battle ground, Mobile data stops working.3. Watching videos and receive call on Bluetooth, call goes blank.Same Bluetooth devices are working with other phones and TV also.OnePlus don't have solution for this problem."

 Worst front camera, 8mp camera would be better than this one.Performance is good.Screen flickering is observed certain times.Really disappointed with oneplus.Even after replacement same issue in the new mobile"
"Pro1. Camera is good2. Heptic feedback good3. No heating issue while playing games like bgmi and no heating while charging4. Charging was very quick5. Speaker are loud and clearCons1. Fingerprint scanner is disappointed me I was using OnePlus 6 where I was having hardware fingerprint scanner which was way faster and accurate.  For on screen scanner I have to wake up screen first then scanner works2. No led light for charging on or off which was there in OnePlus63. Sms are not categorised all sms comes without category, in OnePlus 6 otp and other transactional SMS was coming very user friendly way4. Battery is draining faster optimisation required5. Dual app is not working( clone app)6. Without warning phone restarted and started the update which is surprising7. No 3.5 mm jack8. Provided back cover looks like very average design improvement required9. Plastic body"
"They spent too much on advertisement than on the actual product. Just an average phone with all the hype. I many cases like camera, screen quality, speakers, battery etc etc, there are much better phones in this category. I regret buying, honestly."
"An awsome phone at an affordable price . True to its words its really a flagship killer . I bought the grey one, at first i was skeptical about how its gonna be since its a matte one but wooah when it arrives its just one hell of a stunner !! My suggestion is just go for it."

 The OnePlus Nord 2 is Best in Camera and Design!!Camera Quality!This Camera Really Excited me everytime.Dynamic Range is Very Good even in direct Sun light it's worls very well.And I like Night Mode it's gives usable pictures.The Main 50Mp Camera is Stunning in performance.Battery!Really the Battery performance is Good in this. Everyone is told this is bad but for 4500ah this is very good up to max 8hrs give backup.And Excellent in Charging. Mind-blowing with in 35mins it's full charged.🔥I am only Disappointed with Mild heat near the camera side for the first day and later 1 week use it's good not more heat at all. and 4k video recording is not up to the quality. It's look sharp in Phone but not in 4k monitor.Overall this is Perfect!!!  This is my first OnePlus mobile Best in Camera and Design."
"I like nord 2, my first impressionFirst thanks to Amazon very fast delivery.1.Good looking phone2.OS good3.camera good4.sound good5.fast charging6.display finger print good1.display not super2. little bit heat issue3.i don't feel of 90hz refresh ratephone is good when we give to much expectations that's little bit disappoint...More 5g band support for long term use"
Disappointed.....The camera quality is not up to the mark.The display quality and colour are too bad.The product price is too high but the quality is too bad.
"One plus nailed it!Review after using it for about 4 - 5 daysBuild quality: The blue haze version feels very premium. Love the colour a lot.Performance: Impressed with the overall performance. Tried normal social media usage for 2-3 continuous hours. No issues at all. Tried COD at high quality and frame rate, no issues after 5-6 games...after that it becomes a bit warm which is totally normal for phones in general. At last 90hz is ❤️Camera: This was the deciding factor for me. And it is surprisingly good. I'm attaching a few shots above. Hopefully that'll help. Video is also decent for the price range. The merger with oppo actually feels like an upside...The AI colors gives your photo a nice punch. Front camera is decent. Night mode is really good.Sound: the 2 speakers are loud. The sound lacks a little bass. But that is fine since for high quality audio I use earbuds. 4/5 for phone speakers just because they are a bit on the louder side and I feel the quality could be improved a little bit.Charging: The battery life is decent but the 65w charging just blew my mind. 10 to 100 in 25-30 mins. Really impressive.In conclusion, a really satisfying purchase. You should go for it if you're thinking of buying an all-rounder. Value for money."
The phone purchased with lot of expectation but it is not meet the expectation.The hand set was hanging while using some time. Some time its on/ off switch not operated while trying to open. Volume of the device very low some time ring is not audible even when it is kept on maximum volume.
"Oneplus Nord 2 5G . Sleek body sturdy body with a premium feel is a good android(Oxygen OS) based phone to opt for a relaxed use.But as per the Reviewer hype it is not upto the mark . At 28-32K price range it is just ok kind of phone to opt for . In comparison to One plus Nord2 5G only one phone that is available Google Pixel 4a(which is not launched in India,also have only service centre). In that aspect Nord2 is better choice . Unless being an open mind you can opt for Oneplus nord 2 5G,Google pixel 4a , iPhone SE."
"Please do not buy this product. It was my biggest mistake of my life. It was the 2nd day of my phone and it started undetecting my 2nd sim, the problem persists for more than an month then it started switching off in the middle of call and started hanging up, then after 6 months of use which is today the volume is automatically decreasing and the power button has stopped working. The phone is never dropped and the tag line of One plus is true once you buy this One Plus you never feel settled because it will give you constant issue and you will be hustling to get it fixed. So please do not buy One plus it's worst than Samsung."
* BETTRY DRAINING FAST GOOD PART IS CHARGING ALSO FAST* HEATING UP QUICKLY* IN COMING VOICE CALL TOO SHARP AND LOUD NOT GOOD FOR EARS* APPS SHUT DOWN AUTOMATICALLY MANY TIMES
"Writing after 1 week of mobile usage, and want to let you know it worth it. Its worth every penny you spend on it. Oneplus nord 2 is just an amazing phone, the camera, sound, display(altough its 90 hz, should be 120 but no complains as it feels amazing in 90 itslef.) and the charging speed, everything is just amazing.The only cons that i felt was missing of the 3.5mm headphone jack, rest there is not a single dine of issues with this phone. Everything feels snappy and fast when you use it, and the small form factor of phone makes it easy to use with one hand too. I switched to oneplus nord 2 from poco x3 and it was a big upgrade for me as poco x3 had a big battery of 6000 mah and nord 2 was offering 4500 mah, first i was a little worried about the battery draining issues everyone was talking about, but all of it was just false allegations.My oneplus nord 2 is giving me battery more than one day without charging on heavy usage. So there is no battery issues in this phone. Little worried about the oppofication that is going on behind the scenes.P.S- Alert Slider and finger print sensor works like a charm.Will update more after 1 month of usage."
It is waste of money i haven't recommend anyone to buy this phone hav asked to stop buying OnePlus phonedoesn't hold charge at all drains battery so quickly from the start it is and has been the same - example 100% at 11 am and if i use maps or songs or play video it drains out in 2.30 mins and hav to charge it - it charges quickly but the main concern is drains too quickly didn't expect thisUpon that it really get hot point at i can't hold it in my handCamera works okay - takes good photosBut when use it for too slow - even 15 mins video phone starts getting hot and battery drains quicklyNotification issues too Google keep doesn't go off Even when close itTouch issue and doesn't tap when I click itTouch Settings delay set to quick and using 90 hrz but still no use
"I purchased it with No cost EMI on Amazon Pay - ICICI bank credit card (first time)Please note1. There is Rs 200 extra processing fees hidden and will be charged on your statement. Issue is when I called bank they told Amazon will take care and when I called Amazon bank is charging.2. GST is charged both on Principal & Interest . This amount is not included in the upfront Interest discount that you get from AmazonPhone:.Camera and battery is superbLongevity (max 1.5 years), as its getting hanged after the first update.Ads will popup sometimes in notification , i guess I have to turn it off. See review and unboxing on YouTube before purchasing"
"I hate this phone One Plus Nord 2 12 GB RAM, 256 GB ROM). Because it needs to be charged three times a day even if we don't use it. I am very much disappointed. Please take it back and give my 35000/- back."
"Bought Nord 2 on the first day of release1. Had issues with restarts and product replaced in less than 1 week2. Had issues with Android Auto on my vehicle. One Plus 9R work's but not this. Went to the support center. They informed it's a bug, raised the issue close to a month. All the logs collected when device connected to 9 R, when connected to other cars, when connected to my car. No replies till date3. 3 weeks back when trying to do Software Update it says I'm not logged in as Administrator. Again logged a case, provided logs. No replies4. 1 week back, the Software Update option do not work or there is no option. Again logged a case, provided logs. No replies.4. Did Factory Reset for more than 4 times in 2 months without any results.Please do not buy as you spend 30,000 Plus and no support in any way. When you contact, the first thing they asked to do factory reset which is not providing any solution. Only Pro I can think of this phone is fast charging, put for a charge, have a cup of coffee and charges to a good percentage.Been using Blackberry, iPhone and Samsung as I'm a Messaging Architect and Architect for Mobility in my company and clients..."
"A first time One plus user..1) Look and feel is great2) OS is also pretty good.3) Display quality is awesome4) No heating issues5) Battery charging is super fast.6) performance is good.7) Stereo speakers are also good.A great all round phone in this price range.Cons -1) Photos and videos under low light is not at all good. During video calls, if there is light from background, then the entire video gets a foggy effect. So is the case of low light photography., within the house, with sort of less lighting, the photos are pretty dismal.But outdoor photos and videos on a sunny day is above average.2) Battery life is sort of average. But the fast charge covers it to a certain extent."
"The mobile temperature goes to 41+ degrees while charging or while using.. initially it was occasionally but now frequently..in the rainy season or winter it reaches 41+ , what will happen if it is used in summer season.. and the face unlock was very poor not working properly in day light and in the night it seems there is no function like face unlock and the finger print unlock was taking nearly 30sec or more to unlock.The glass of display and back was very weak and easily broken from a small drop . Very disappointed by OnePlus ."
"Dear sir,Order code:1091201391336I ordered a cellphone oneplus nord 5G. I received the product on 17th January 2022. I started using from 19th onwards. Now I doubt that it may be a diffetive one because it becomes hot while calling. During video calls it gets cut in-between. Kindly replace it with a perfect."
"Writing this review after 48 hours of usage.This is my first One Plus device and after using it extensively for 48 hours, here are my observations:The Good:- Premium feel in hand! Feels just like a flagship device. I have the Grey Sierra version.- Stunning screen and amazing haptic feedback gives you a great experience - I guess this is especially true for new One Plus users like me.- No bloatware, smooth OS with some amazing eye catching design and animations.- The rear camera takes some amazing pictures- especially in amole natural lightning and even night mode.- The dual speakers provide a good sound experience- 65W charger is stunning! From 25% to 90% in just 18 minutes!The bad:- The front camera is worthless - especially when you are using it against light. It takes VGA quality picture in this kind of setting- Battery drains very fast - even when phone is in an idle state with single SIM operation. Dealbraker.- While updating, Chinese text is displayed on the screen.- No earphone jackI believe that these issues can be solved with an OTA update. Will update this review as and when that happens."
"Overall is good.Weight management is goodNice processor for business purposes and soft user's.Not got for Gamer'sRear Camera is average. Skin tones are not real, shows high saturation.Rear camera is good for taking Nature picture. But while taking Person, it's showing high saturation.Night mode/low light photos are goodWide angle shots are ok.Macro photography are ok.""Need update in rear camera"".Amazing with 32MP selfie camera.Picture are good. Skin tones are real.Portrait shots both in front and rear camera are good.90Hz resolution is ok but if it comes with 120Hz would really appreciate.Amazing work in Battery. Fast charging with just 45 minutes to take full charging."
"The vowifi call drops frequently when I am switch between rooms in house/ or even one signal drop in wifi , the reciever goes blank.I got 12-256 gb grey, looks good and elegant, but metal frame would be a good add on.Not good for people who are into daily gaming of 1-2 hours.go for iqoo7.I switched from MI poco f1 to this. UX is drastically drops here as basic apps are very basic.Example : calculator comes with only scientific calc option while MIUI had height weight currency etc. On call functions have a scroll , everything should have been made compact and available once you pull you phone from the ear.Camera is superb. Try clicking mono in potrait with 2x zoom, u'll be amazed (with good light) .Internet works superfast. connected to 5g wifi and download speed was very fast."
Heating issue is there and it's too much and lagg is also there but totally disappointed with heat issue want replacement of the phone I will suggest to wait for buying phone now..or go for good phone under 30k
Pros:Build quality is premiumSoftware experience even after color os merger is clean and bloatware freeCamera performance is great and it takes good picsBattery efficiency is really good and warp charge is one of the best in businessCons:Missing out of the box notification ledHints of color os in the software3.5mm jack missingStill overall a great package considering other available options. If you are into gaming you  may want to go for a SD processor otherwise this fit rite for most of the people.
Nord 2 battery is 4500 mah but in half day it used to drain. Also as many people faced phone blasting issue. I was really happy with one plus 6 mobile no issues with it. I made a decision to switch only because it was 3 and half years old.. new one plus phones not even worth of it.. so sold my nord 2 and bought iPhone 12 during Amazon Diwali offer
The phone has an option to snooze the alarm  by power or volume key but it doesn't work even with an update. Alarm keeps on ringing unless you go to the alarm app and turn it off there.I found another issue that is the call recording. The other person easily gets to know that you are recording it. Because the phone says loudly that the call is being recorded. To overcome the problem i tried installation of many call recording apps but even after giving all permissions no app worked properly. During call the other persons voice isn't being recorded. I am getting a feel that i got a wrong choice in changing from samsung to OnePlus.One more issue i found is with video calls the apps like google duo whatsapp suddenly loooses access to camera and also the screen shuts off while video calling on duo. Direct video call is hardly conected.This is not a good product to choose. Better to go for other brands like samsung and realme those a cheaper and better than this.
There are already a lot of reviews praising the phone. Definitely there are some good features like camera and fast charging but the negative aspects are more significant.The phone hangs a lot...even without too many apps or storage availability. It hangs every time you do a video call on whatsapp or keeps lagging even while watching videos on youtube. The lagging problem persists even while scrolling through the screen or icons. In clear words..it's very frustrating. Feels like I wasted my money.
"I am new to OnePlus. My old phone was Redmi note 7 and what i like in OnePlus is that there are no ad's in oneplus UI. And the Camera is good. I had considered other options like in Samsung, Xiaomi, Realmi etc but Nord 2 stood up against each of them. After 1 week of my Usage I like the battery back up and wrap charger features(It only takes 30 mins to charge it from battery low to Full). The UI is awsome. There isn't much System apps like in MI phones.One issue i think is an issue is the fingerprint sensor is a bit lagging when compared to my old phone"
"Till the time , I have used the phone, camera is good(although I have not used the phone camera much. Processor is also fast (have not found any lag while playing cod.) I will check vedio rendering speed and will update about it.Display quality is also nice , since I have earlier used OnePlus 6t, It is better than that display.Audio quality is awesome.Charging with 65 watt is something magical. Hardly takes 40 minutes to charge 0 to 100%.Camera -4/5Battery - 3.5/5Charging speed -5/5Audio - 5/5Display - 4/5Processor 4/5Overall 4.5/5"
"Brought this phone by exchanging my OnePlus 6. I feel OnePlus 6 far better than this phone..it got compromised with lot of features what OnePlus 6 and it's series has.. Biggest issue with this phone is Heating problem, it's feel like you are holding a warm iron brick even for normal usage, with the recent update heating is somewhat reduced.  camera is average.. Battery Back-up is average but you can charge it very quickly. New OnePlus users may satisfied with this phone but OnePlus fans gets disappointed..It's missing the essence OnePlus quality and uniqueness."
"As per the recent communication by OnePlus, it(Nord series) will receive only one major OS update. So, if you are expecting a phone with major updates for the next 2-3 years, this is not that one, keep that in mind. Also about the price point, it is a bit higher, if we are not supposed to get major OS updates. Anyways one plus will start giving discounts after 3-4 months.1. Speaker sound quality - 5 star.2. Battery charging - 5 star.3. Battery discharging - 3 star4. Screen quality - 4 star5. Call quality - 5 starMissing:1. Notification LED2. 3.5mm jack(won't be missed much due to wireless earbuds)3. Expected a tempered glass from OnePlus"
"Review after 1 month......You know the pros like processor, camera, 90hz, etc etc.I was only experiencing less battery backup at initial time and huge battery drain at night.Solution: I am keeping my phone switched off at night. Also turning battery optimization for specific battery draining apps has helped. Now I get about 7 hr screen on time which is perhaps more than enough for an average user. Initially the phone took 40 min to charge fully. But now it charges completely within 30 min, as advertised.A little bit heating issue, but ""not overheating"". Keeps around 37 degree Celsius. Highest temperature I recorded was 41 degree( playing PES in max settings).The new update has also fixed battery drain issue.Overall my experience is superb, specially in such price segment.**{Don't compare it to poco de gt, that has only two 5g bands, no ois, and moreover MIUI.... Famous for bugs and lags. Literally I have experienced lag only once in this whole month of use}*Anyway, people may have their individual opinion. But since I am writing this review, so I have expressed my own opinion. Don't get hurt.Conclusion: Overall good. Nothing is perfect. But in comparison this may be your next budget-premium phone"
Superb phone premium look all features are very goodBut Amazon was cheat my charger was missing at the delivery time and tell me after complaint no responsibility of Amazon. Service was wrost for Amazon.
"I am using one plus 6 since 2019.I really enjoyed OnePlus 6 with the great and intuitive oxygen OS. with the same impression I have recently purchased one plus Nord 2 5G, but I am disappointed with the fresh oxygen OS which is pretty much similar to Realme OS/Oppo OS and GUI is not at all ok.One plus team please don't change the OS.Camera is better than its previous generation phone and battery life is  also considerably improved"
"The overall feedback is ""Satisfactory"" only, but I have expected something more since it's from ""OnePlus"".Pros:1) Fast charging, approx 40mins to get 100%.2) Smooth display, screen enhancement with MediaTek 1200 AI worked well.3) Primary camera quality is awesome for this price segment.4) Ohh Yes, the new front camera sensor serves its purpose. it's much better than the former one.5) Overall phone performance is good.Cons:1) Fastest discharging, reduces to 20% with 4 to 5hrs (I'm a regular user, no gaming, no streaming more than an hour, additionally just turned on hotspot for my work)2) Wide angle camera is not good.3) If you have experienced the original OXYGEN OS already, Then the mix of oxygen OS and Colour OS surely will disappoint you."
"1.camera is best2.look bulky but not feels much3.speakers are great till now4.in display finger print not show quick5.amoled display looks great nice refresh rate smooth touch response and quick too6.fast charging if u don't use while charging7.battery is not upto the mark (i) It drains to quick(ii)If u play bgmi at any graphic settings it will drain 20-25% battery in just 50-60 minute of gameplay(iii)if ur a below normal user then it will give u a whole day battery backup8.Heats alot while gaming like I feel it in my hand bcz of its dimensity processor9.call recording start announcing that recording is onHence, buy if u're a below average user bcz it's not for heavy use or gaming for my opinion don't buy Nord 2 for 30k go for Snapdragon chipset or buy OnePlus 9rt adding few more thousands."
"After 3 days of use!!1. Took some some to complete the initial updates!2. Once initial updates are completed, you can't fasten your belt and start the amazing journey.3. Really easy to transfer data and contacts from old phone to Nord.4. Amazing fingerprint and face unlock system.5. Sound quality is just superb with dual speaker!!6. Charges really fast!! With data on, it charged 40% in 12 mins.7. Camera is again!! Pretty cool.. though it could've been a little better!!Overall, it's a really awesome buy in 35k.Thanks to my HDFC offer, got a discount nof ₹1750"
"First oneplus device for me. I was very eager to buy the oneplus phone and experience of the oxygen OS. I was realme 2 pro user and believe me it's huge upgrade in every aspects for me.1) No leg in daily usage. Display is very smooth. If you are thinking the 120hz display is better then 90hz, it's not. One can hardly notice the difference. So 90 hz would be not be a problem. Also it's 600 nits display, but it's very very bright enough.2) In every online platform I show the pictures of the phone and thought the bottom chin is big phone but when the phone in hand it's not like that big. It's acceptable. The bezels are also very small.3) The charging speed is very fast. It charges 0-100% in just 33-35 min. Phone can easily survive in whole day in rough usage. So battery backup would not be an issue.Edited: After using phone a week, I can say that the battery backup is not up to the mark. Based on 4500mah tag it should give  more then 1 day. But mostly I need to charge the phone twice a day. Very disappointed. Aslo some apps are getting crashed ocassionaly.4) The fingerprint scanner is working very well5) It not fills that heavy in hand, the thickness is also acceptable.6) One major experience is haptics in the phone. While typing and in any touch areas the experience is at next level like a flagship phone7) I have not tested the camera thoroughly but for now the camera seems pretty promising. I will update on this once take more photo samples.8) It's stereo speakers and it's very loud. Not distortion at max volume. Not like flagship leval phone but it's loud enough.Till date in hands on this phone it's very very good. I will highly recommend if you want to experience a clean oxygen OS. Instead of buying oneplus 9r/9, I would recommend to buy this one.Hope this will be helpful to choose wisely."
Pros:1)back camera fab2)Fast charge(full charge in 32 min)3)smooth usage4)good refresh rate5)dual video view6)smooth user experience7)good sound experienceCons:1)front camera below average2)charging drains faster continuous usage from100% to 0% in 5½ hours
"Bought this device 5 months ago and I can say overall this is great package.Look:device feels premium than any other phone in this price rangePerformance: one word snappy got 10 different updates by oneplus to improve performanceBattery : amazing getting 6 to7 hr SOT whole day batteryCamera:Main camera is Awsome  I just took some. Pictures at evening 7.30 pm for birthday party and all got just awesome clicks with night mode. In light it's performance is very good, But selfi cam is okBattery heating issue:I didn't felt any of this device working Awsome.Software : software is smooth and user friendly but not as good as original oxygen osThird party development : If you are fans of custom rom you can buy this because now device getting lots of android 12 custom roms, you can check this YouTube channel 4U tech having all about nord 2Final conclusion: it's a overall good package for this money"

 Good Ponts:-1. Batterty life is great and fast charging also great.2.  Camer is better performance in night mode, I impressed. but not a good work some time in normal photo in sunlight.3. Display quality is so great and gives a better experience during watching movies.Bad Points: -1. Big problem is that the fingering scanner is not work smoothly on Ambient display than scanning on wake display.2. Finger should scan directly, but its need at least one click before the finger scan on Ambient display.3. Diplay brightness is poor in sunlight. Other phones is better preform under 20,000 INR.4. Vibrator is poor than other phones.5. Sound quality is good only when see the movies and poor when listening music.(A Little problem  is facing during incoming call, is that when I receive a call while doing any task, its open on whole display, then I go the home Butten and go the same task again. then the call going in back ground, so I can do my task again."
"1. The best thing about this product is it's Front camera and back camera. I switched from my 7t to this phone and camera is certainly an upgrade for me.2. Fingerprint sensor is just amazing.3. Go fot It, the product is super awesome and worth it under 30k for your D2D Usage.4. Battery Life is amazing on normal' usage works a day for me, nothing to worry about they have backed us with 65w charger 40% in 15 mins.Go for it guys !"
"I was excited about getting a OnePlus phone for clicking amazing pictures, But as it turns out OnePlus Nord 2 is actually a Oppo phone with packaging done by OnePlus.The camera is seriously a huge disappointment. I am currently using Mi-A3 phone which costs 12K and it has a much better camera.Totally disappointed with this stupid gimmic played by OnePlus. Selling oppo phone was not atall ethical."
Heating issue. My mobile reached 47 C when Playing BGMI. Also it heats on charging. I can not roam around carring a china made live bomb as while rebooting the text comes in china language. Even the camera when using on 5x 10 X ZOOM THE IMAGE quality is very poor. Noisy and blur images. The only thing good in camera is night mode which is not often used. I would suggest to buy one plus mobile from store and not online as the seller Darshita electronic provided the replacement for my nord 2 but the packaging was so poor that it seem to me that the box has been already openend and is then delivered to me
"If you are the guy who have never purchased any oneplus phone and thinking that nord 2 would be the first one to buy then this review is for you:Display: (4.5/5) Really good display with punchy colours but i would mention that for some of ott platform videos it could have been better.Camera: (5/5) Best camera module i have seen as compared to samsung good mid-range phones also.Performance: (4.5/5) Top notch with buttery smooth gaming performance. There were minor shutter lag which i have noticed but it can be ignored.Battery: (4.5/5) you should know that oneplus phones are know to give a good backup even if the battery is <5%, so summing that up you get good performance with good backup which will last you 20 hr for moderate to heavy usage.Haptics and feel: (5/5) it's the best and i can say you will feel that you are using flagship level phone.All together i can say that if you are oneplus fan and planning to buy a phone in mid-range price bracket, you should definitely go for it."
"The phone is great in almost every aspect. The nightmode in the phone is really good which is pretty nice, thanks to that primary sensor but the ultrawide is meh, Samsung's A52 is better, the battery life is good and fast charging is great. Only problem I noticed is that the phone heats up a lot sometimes, specially when gaming, but it doesn't affect performance, just that I don't feel comfortable while gaming for more than half an hour. Also the battery heats up a bit more than it should when charging which makes me a feel bit scary after that *news* 🙊. So I switched to a 33 watt redmi charger and the charging speed is still very good and also the battery doesn't heat up even slightly. Also I really wish they kept the headphone jack.My conclusion is that its a great overall phone which has the basics done right with a great primary camera and smooth OS (yes there's the colorOS integration but I personally don't mind it, frankly colorOS is also a great OS in terms of customisation) but if ur a gamer and wanna play every game at the higher graphics better go for the Poco F3 GT or the realme x7 max if u don't like miui."
"Since this is my 1st phone above 15k,i had to choose very carefully the mobile i am going to use for the next 3 years & i am seeing the signs that i picked the right one. Pros :- •Gorgeous Design•Excellent stereo speakers.•Good Cameras.•Pretty Clean UI.•Speedy Fast Charging.Some minor issues. •Heats like hell while charging (Both Brick and Phone) •Asks Too many permissions for many apps. I don't consider the abscence of Headphone jack and SD card storage as a thing as it's common in this price segment. Overall, I'm loving it without any regrets."
From every point of views of specs and performance of this phone is decent and balanced but yeah I am facing over heating issues soo OnePlus should watch towards..Front facing camera is also fails to white balanceOverall the look of this phone is awesome and 50 mp primary shooter too
"Below average battery and camera performance, OnePlus is getting inconsistent with it's quality control. Really like the smoothness and processor but doesn't matter if I have to carry the big charger everywhere with me. 2hours of navigation everyday sucks up the juice like anything, battery performance is bad and that's a big issue for me. Even visited the service center and they say they can't do anything the device is fine. Slightly disappointed from the standards of OnePlus"
"Review after 10 days usage -If you are looking for a phone under 30K then this must be one of the options you consider apart from Realme x7 max & IQOO 7.After having used this device for more than 10 days continuously, here is my review -Network reception - Better than my last phone (Realme 2 pro) + 5G support (6 bands - No other brand other than realme giving these many)Camera - Sony IMX 766 Sensor (You will be surprised how good is the night mode).Screen - Super Amoled 🤩 No brightness or green tint issuesProcessor - Dimensity 1200 💪🏻 (you can get SD 870 around same price point but both Dimensity 1200 & SD 870 perform nearly same in day to day usage).Haptics - Superb.Charging - 65W chargers are really superfast (29 mins to go from 0-100% while switched off 🤩 first 5 min 22%).Battery - 4500 mAh usually gives 7-8 hrs SOT with 30-40 min gaming (easily lasts a day with normal usage)UI - I'm loving this UI so far. Clean & smooth experience.RAM Management - Super (Recent apps are not killed while not in use)Overall Verdict - If you are looking for an all-rounder with good camera, performance & clean UI + OP brand value definitely purchase this device. You will never be disappointed ✌🏻"
The refresh rate is just awesome-Camera is fabulous-Gaming is excellent-65 Watt charger charges in 38 minutes-Display is soothing-Color is just wow..Stock android no unnecessary app in phoneExcellent design and in hand experience is too good
First of all I am telling you that the phone charged only 15 to 20 min so I m impressed. But some issues with this phone... like......1st is auto audio recording because phone has auto recording but it is manually and the front gets to know the recording.2nd is battery life because full phone charged work only 12hours
"Their are some bugs in this phone . Sometimes Facebook/other applications is getting automatically closing during use.Back camera is good , front camera is OK.Call recording policy is worst. It should be change by OnePlus team. While recording any call one message is delivered by phone to other caller.Battery backup is good. The good thing is battery gets full charge in 25 to 30 min.I haven't play game yet so can't share gaming experience."
"Pros:Performance (10/10) : It is fast and I never felt any lag, I am not a gamer.Battery (10/10): I love the charging speed, you will see the magic in 25-30 minutes and the battery backup is good.Design (10/10) : It feels premium and build quality is good.Speakers (8/10) : crisp and clear voice. enough loudness.camera (7/10) : You will not get any out of the world experience but it takes good photos. You will get very good portrait photos and low light is also good but front camera is average. I have attached two photos. one from nord2 and one from moto g5s plus (4 years old) . of course, Nord 2 captures better details but I would not say huge improvement considering moto is 4 years old and still taking a decent photo from its 13MP camera.UI : UI is good, people are crying on youtube over color os,  do not take them seriously.Cons:No earphone Jack .Privacy issues : you have to give permission for lots of things but privacy on the internet is a myth. until now we were sending our data to US servers now it will also go to Chinese servers.The camera could have been better but can not complain for 30k.Most of the people are confused between nord 2 Vs mi 11x Vs Realme X7 Vs Poco F3 GT Vs IQ00 7I was also confused, I wanted a phone which I can use for at least 4 years and as I said I am not a gamer so I will not feel any performance difference. I was looking for future proof phone if you compare all the above devices nord2 has the highest number of 4G bands forget about 5G. Carrier aggregation is also good."
"So it's my first time using a OnePlus smartphone phone after I was impressed by their product 1+ 7T. Though the price is very less than it's flagship phone 1+ 9pro , it offers you the same rich amd premium feeling.1) Built quality- It's very impressive, you'll have a smile on your face (if you haven't invested more than 20k in a smartphone before) after you'll hold it. And for me, the looks really matter in any product, it has to be appealing and I'll have to say that I'm appealed to it sight.2) Display & Camera- Very crisp and detailed. The display gives you the feel of S20 series of the Samsung. We can say that they could've improved their camera but, what more we can expect in an entry level smartphone. Right?3) Audio- The stereo speakers are amazing, like mind blowing. There are two speakers in this phone so you don't need to resort to headphones if you're watching a movie alone. It almost gives the cinematic experience.4) Battery- I think this is the last part which needs some analysis before buying a smartphone. I'll have to say that the battery drains a little too fast or maybe it's because the battery capacity is 4500 mAh. But it charges very quick so.Bottomline, if you don't wanna spend too much in a smartphone, which is around 50k then go for this. Cuz even of you'll sell it later- you'll get a better resale value for this brand than it's competitors. Which is another big plus point. Rest I leave it to your wisdom to choose."
"HiIam very much disappointed and worried about my nee mobile one plus , hearing news all over that mobile is exploding while on calls or using ,if anything like that I want to exchange this mobile to another brand at same value or if u could offer anything at same price please … this is serious issue as it linked with life threatening matter , please consider my request .Thanks"
"I received the phone on 27th (pretty fast). When I opened the box and checked the phone and it wasn't switching on (something was written on the left side of the screen) and I tried everything to strt, then I replaced it(surprisingly it switching on the next day as I charged it to give to the dilevery boy) and then recieved the new one on the next day. Thanks to Amazon for such a good service!Now I have been using this phone for almost 2 full days so now I know I think I can write the review.The display is good and the 90hz can is super smooth.The speakers are damm good, super loud.The haptics are very short, minimal and strong.The performance is top notch, no heating issues noticed yet.The camera is good, main camera is great, low light is just awesome, the ultra wide is good but the pictures are a bit smooth. The selfie are good too.The battery is the best part, I charged it full yesterday and now it is at around 20 percentage, almost 8 hrs of screen on time on light usage(no gaming) but ya on gaming and heavy usage it can easily last for 6 to 7 hrs. And the charging is just mind boggling it literally charges 55 percent in just 15 mins.I think if you want the overall package with a blotfree experience, nice camera, good performance then this is your choice. But if only want to game then there are better options (Poco F3 GT)."
NO CALL RECORDING FEATURE WITHOUT INFORMING THE OTHER PARTY.BIG NEGATIVE.PLAY STORE ASKING ASKING ME TO REMOVE APPS TO DOWNLOAD NEW ONES(WHICH I LAST OBSERVED IN FIRST GENERATION SMART PHONE) EVEN THOUGH I HAVE FREE STORAGE OF MORE THAN 80 GB.WHATSPP CLONE APP NOT WORKING.GOD ONLY WHAT AMAZING THINGS I AM ABOUT TO WONDER WITH THIS DAMN PHONE.
I am facing an issue. The slow motion videos are not good and are shaky.Without flash light it is recording slow Mo videos in a pathetic quality. Just want to ask if this is in nord 2 defect or the defect in the piece that I have received.
"The phone is flawless in every manner, except of a few small flaws which includesGlitchy microphone: it has a random low pitch and low resonance sound.People can hear themselves back while in video calls.Otherwise, its a great phone overall; great for gaming, and basically a near-flagship."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Over all good product.Only glitch is the seemingly poor battery backup. Yes the 67W warp charge adapter covers up for it(super duper fast charger), but still, with a Bluetooth headset connected and approx 1hour audio music streaming, battery drained real fast.Face unlock is funny though, it captures and unlocks the phone just if my face is in the vicinity of front camera. Not a deal breaker. Finger print scanner works fast. Camera is good. Low-light is good but looks artificial.Only if one plus had given 3yrs of OS update and 4 years of security patch update."
I was nt expecting  this kind of phone from oneplus 😞since first day..iam facing issue no applications  working within seconds it get close getting error internal storage full 😳I have 8 gb ram 256 versionPlease refund my money i dont want this pathetic  phoneAmzon dont sell this phone u will loose your good customers
"Phone UI is not to the mark.. it shouldn't placed under OnePlus brand.. My last phone was OnePlus 6 which is very smooth & UI is top notch. The 3 years old phone has better options than oneplus nord2.Simple features like Message grouping, auto call recording options are very pathetic in nord2. Highly disappointed."
Writing this review post 10 days of using it1. Battery gets heated while in charge2. Battery back up doesn't last for half day3. Mobile gets automatically hang while using more than 2 application4. Fingure print unlock doesn't work appropriately5. Over all suggestion would be not to buy this and not worth 30K+6. Wish I get a exchange or return for my money

I am not sure why people are going gaga over Nord 2. This phone seriously has got performance and camera quality issues. Bought this for my sister( upgraded from Nord). She is not happy with the faulty device plus service technician team is useless.
"First of all, I thank Amazon for the fast delivery.OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone is a premium phone under 30k. Its camera quality is really stunning and the audio quality is outstanding. Regarding its battery life, little improvement could have been done (With internet on phone may have charge for max.24hours). The screen refresh rate is exceptional and the phone will be charged within 25-30 mins.The major drawback is that the phone does not have a 3.5mm audio port. An external connector is required for this purpose.Overall phone is awesome and enjoying ."
Sometimes phon hangs and during calls screen goes to black screen. So not able to cut the call. Heating is there a little. Better choose relame phone or vivo. One plus Nord lost is touch even in UI also and I'm not sure about other one plus phones. It is over hyped phone and not gud for this price segment.
"OnePlus Nord slogan (Pretty much everything you could ask for) doesn't meet its requirement in this model. Everything is there, but not up to the mark expected from OnePlus. Disappointed with my first experience with OnePlus. Was feeling excited about owning OnePlus, however, Nord is not a right choice for my expectations. Writing this review with full of dissatisfaction.Sharing my views basis two weeks of usage, yet to explore more:1. Heating Issues. Even for taking an one minute video the phone is highly heating up.2. Camera photos and selfies appears standard. Should have been updated with high quality at this price range.3. At times facing Network connectivity issues for Dual Sim connectivity.4. Charging works faster, but phone battery evoparates like petrol."
Nice phoneI have purchased it on very first day sale with exchange offer. It cost me 25749 rupees .Pros: 1) phone looks are just awesome and in hand feel is decent .2) Music quality is quite decent with best in class dual sterio sound3) Charging is fast  it took 20 minute in charging from 30% to 99%4) Cemra look decent in indoor but it quality can be improve in outdoor5) Ui experience is quite smoth6) No issue while gamingCons :1) No HD content streaming on Amazon prime video2) Cemra is good but not decent as per price range
"This is my first OnePlus phone. This is one day impression. What I like isDisplay: 5* best in 30kRear camera: 4* not a problem with rear camera it has everything what I need. Crystal clear,Selfie camera is okey okey, something like midrange oppo phonePerformance: 5 starWhat I miss , is sound quality in blootooth device very everage quality. OnePlus has to correct this by ota update even my redmi note 7 pro has good sound output."
"Phone gets heated up whenever I go outside for work. Luckily I have work from home as of now.Camera quality looks like any cheap mobile of range 14-16k.Camera focus does not workBattery drains very fast. 2 hrs screen time.Heating issue make the phone badWhenever you search apps, it gets hanged and loads all apps again"
"Been using this phone for a month now and gotta admit it's the most astonishing phone I've used. The best you can get at this price range, display could've been 120hz, but 90hz will work smooth as well. The camera is as expected, a solid one. The battery life amazingly surprised me! It easily gives you on screen 8-9 hours. The performance is marvelous! Overall the best ever phone I ever used."
"Phone is good enough with nice camera and fast charger.I don't find any heating issues or any other lag like crashing of apps, may be due to limited usage of phone without much of high end games.No issues with connectivity and phone looks premium.But still I feel it should costs around 25k not much as you have other phones with same features are around 20 to 25k.Just if you exclude 5g as still it will take few years to have 5g to can't comment on that.Overall phone is good, but could have with less price comparing to other same range phones"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was concerned about blast issue but I took the risk and get the reward. Yes it's not perfect, it doesn't has 120hz display, just 8mp wide angle sensor, slowly loosing its oxygen os charm but it has a good quality stereo speaker, good haptics, latest sony sensor camera with ois and also fast charging. Overall satisfied with this device. Someone who is looking for overall good phone I highly recommend this device."

 Can enjoy smooth gaming (bgmi) as well as nyc camera just need to focus little bit and little setting according to pic to get perfect shot , good video stabilization 4k but video is not totally smooth focus looses while shooting video sometimes i am happy with the purchase best phone in this range in my point of view"
"Not as worthy phone I don't recommend anyone to buy this phone at cost of 30k or 35k. I have used so many OnePlus phone but this is not good quality phone.. it heats too much, also hang sometimes overall my experience is not soo good with this phone .. i suggest to buy OnePlus 9 series to get good product instead of wasting worthfull 30k or 35k on this phone"
"Phone is very good but I will only tell you the cons which I feel could have made the phone better.1. No headphone jack even connector not included in the box.2 No earphone mode(settings) as available in all other oneplus phones.3. Battery backup is for a day or max 36 hours in any case, you use the phone or you just keep the phone.4 I have never been a fan of OnePlus camera and again the situation is same.5 Fingerprint scanner is on display."
It has been one month since I purchased this mobile. However my worst dream has come true. I purchased this mobile with 12 GB ram so that I may not face any lag issue in normal day to day operations. However to my surprise it is just impossible to use phone now. The usage is very much similar to unfer 10K samsung phone which takes huse time in responding to apps and any command feed to it.I have lodged complaint to CEO of One plus China nd Inda along with Twitter complaint and NCH complaint. I am very very disappointed with the performance of this mobile.It's a strong suggestion to ignore this purchase and opt for any other brand.
"I received the phone 2 days after ordering. The package was in good condition.I have been using this phone for now 3 days. My experience till now is like -Camera - Go for it, excellent camera, 50MP main sensor is just wonderful. Videography is also superb. Thanks to colored oxygen os now we get oppo camera app and it has better features. Front camera is also good. Not that excellent but good!Display - You will love this display. Smooth and sharp, amoled display. 90hz just feel amazing. Colors are beautiful.Speakers - The main highlighting thing of this phone. Stereo speakers. Just amazing. The loudness is out of this world. Even at full volume the sound doesn't get distorted.Battery - 4500 mAh battery can get you run your phone from morning to night very easily. It is ok because they give you 65W charger and that is crazy fast. Just 30 min gone and your phone is fully charged.Fingerprint and FACE unlock - Fingerprint is OK. 9/10 times it recognises and is fast. Face unlock is blazing fast. You just look to camera and it gets unlock in mili seconds.Design - Looks premium in hand. It feels you are holding a 30k phone. Alert slider is there. I got the blue haze color which is really awesome. Overall excellent looking phone.Network - I am using Airtel sim and I got really good speed. Like about 1mbps to 2mbps downloading speed. 4G+ is not available in my area.Get this phone If you are planning to buy a 30k phone. You won't be disappointed. Don't go for that color os merging thing. It doesn't affect the oneplus experience. And if you are first time oneplus user you won't even notice that."
Let me be very precise.... Everything is gr8 what u expect from one plus like build quality smooth os  stereo speakers ...but the camera  is worst ... Highly inconsistent ..sometime capture good pics but sometimes worst .....not optimised properly...even Samsung's under 25k phones have better camera results ...... exposure problem is so much that u cant even save photos for memory only forget about uploading on insta ...
So it has been 4 days I have received this product nd I would surely recommend u nt to buy this phone bcz it's battery is draining really fast like 100 percent charging doesn't even stay 24 hrs. And when I complained Abt it one person visited checked in it's app be told that battery life is healthy jst on the basis of the app but doesn't see tht battery is nt lasting even 24 hrs . After spending this much rs if we r nt getting proper phone then it's of no use. I will surely never buy anything from Amazon.
"I bought this mobile in august 2021, am giving this review after using this mobile for 20 days. Actually this is my first one plus mobile. camera clarity is nice, audio quality is good, battery life is good, fast charge is awesome. within half an hour you will get full charge from 30 percent charge. But slow motion camera not upto the point. It is good to use guys"
"Best OnePlus phone launched in 2021 (till mid year). Much better than one plus 9R which has below average cameras. Nord 2 camera is on par, with much loved one plus 7 series (good).A true 5G phone with 5-6 bands. While the processor is mediatech, it is their flagship version and phone works great, with no heating issues. Refresh rate of 90 Hz is a balanced choice, as it does not strain the battery. Go for it, instead of spending 10-30k more on other 2021 one plus versions (till Aug 2021)."
"I purchased one plus nord2 phone before 4 month. Now there is saveral issues. When i plan video , audio and pick the call then it is automatic switched off and heating problem. Taking time for battary charging.When i contact to one plus customer care, they did not solve this issues. Its totally waste of money. So please dont buy one plus phone. Because i wasted 35000/- . And services are not good."
"Writing this review almost after one month of use, got my phone next day after launch:Pros: Premium design, processor, camera except wide angle, night camera is one of the best. Great for mild gaming, charging is super fastCons: wide angle camera"
"I received the phone in 4 days the phone looks and feels superb. Display is good but not bright enough for outdoor usage. Performance wise, the phone lags at times. Camera is good and fingerprint scanner is feels a bit slow if you are switching from phone with physical fingerprint scanner phone. I heard a lot about oxygen os but this one broke all my expectations, software is buggy. Battery backup is OK and 65w charger does very good job."
The phone is great. Though writing the review only after using it for 3 days. There are not many already installed apps. So that's a relief and the ones pre- installed can be used. The main attraction is the camera. The pictures and videos are just amazing. The performance and the UI are also just soo smooth. There is hardly any lag. The battery get drained fatser though and needs once a day charging depending on the usage. But the charging is super fast. Within 30 minutes the phone is charged from 24% to 94%.
All good after update it's  a super mobile it's worth able every penny
"This review is after using the phone for more than 2 months.I used other mobiles which have more premium processors and refresh rates. But,I love it more than all of those. The reasons are:1.This is such an excellent phone given its pricing and performance. It is buttery smooth when we consider the performance. No lags found anytime.2.Display quality is awesome. I felt 90Hz is the best among along refresh rates. Videos give the best experience on this phone.3.Fingerprint is fast.4.No annyoying ads or bloatware. Clean experience. This is really important for a stressless and smooth daily usage.5.UI is excellent. Easy to use.6.Connectivity is awesome.7.Call quality is good.8. Other features like NFC and multiple users etc are worth a mention.9. Games play very well. No lags at all.10. The best best thing about this phone is, its charging speed. It's ultra ultra fast. No phone can beat this in terms of charging. Just a 5 min of charge can help you complete all your urgent and important tasks.11. Protective case is the best quality and it saved me from phone drops multiple times. I suggest to use the one provided in the box as its of a very good quality.12. Overall the form factor is good, light weight and easy to carry and use.13. No heating issues at all.Cons:1. Battery performance is bad when connected to mobile data. Drains like anything. You need to charge it twice, if you access mobile data throughout the day. But, it's better on wifi.2. Back camera quality is bad even in good lighting conditions. It doesn't look like a 50MP one. Cant even perform any better than an average camera of phones under 20k. Under low light, very poor performance.3. Front camera is good in good lighting conditions. Again dissapoints in bad lighting conditions.4. Both cameras lacks in giving clear details and adds a lot of noise.Irrespective of Camera and battery issues I still consider this as a good value for money, performance for price phone.You can decide whether to purchase or not based on your requirements."
We have purchased a remarkable device OnePlus nord 2 in first day first sale but not satisfied with its battery performance as on standby it's battery drains so fast.We have put our device in night at 51 % and in morning it's automatically drain to 7 %What's this ?
This is a perfect phone who wants a premium phone under 40K what else you need.I am using this phone from more than 50 hours not a single issue glitch faced. Regarding front cameras an update came early morning and that fixed a lot of issue still some issue with front facing.Cons why to buy:1. Camera is plus point2. Oxygen os is buttery smooth and the haptics my god just wow.3. Battery almost goes 6+ hours and charge only in 30 min lightning fast⚡4. Display is also too good and speakers are just wowwwww what a sound it provides btw earphone jack not there but you can use type c to 3.5 mm jack and it also provides a loud and bass boosted music5. And Looks are ♥️6. Wifi speed gives awesome and 4+ in my area from sim 17. I played pubg and asphalt 9 with max settings no heating issue no lags.Cons:1. Sim2 network is not good don't know the issue2.missed 3.5 mm jack not a big issue
"Amazon is totally misguided under exchange, in FAQs there is mentioned exchange is applicable on flat 1000 bank offer, but when u purchase applying exchange no discount given by Amazon as it min purchase value disturbed,........u r giving ur product at minimum value under exchange and also cut ur roots by own axe...... What a shameful act"
A big NO to Oneplus. Their purpose is just to sell phones and after sales service is zero. It’s been more than a month I’ve given my new phone for repair and there is no response from them. Such a disgusting and pathetic company. If you want harassment in life please go for it. Never never never never never never never never recommend it to anyone. Please please please please avoid buying any product from Oneplus. A big NO.
I liked the overall product.. fast charging is awesome and camera is also good except wide angle one... The only concern is phones exploding ( as per news) that needs to be resolved by one plus urgently .. atleast release a audit report so that we know what all things to take care of
"Lets be honest, this phone costs 3 times less than a premium iphone, yet offers twice the storage, almost similar battery life, thrice the charging speed (66w, iphone offers 20w) and a seamless experience. This is a phone that gets the job done.Iphone has much better screen quality, battery life I believe is higher because the phone is extremely thick and the camera of course.But other than that, I dont see anything where it lacks. Just perfect.To sum up, Super fast (charging and screen refresh rate). Never lags/hangs. 256 gigs of super storage, highly customiseable, highly efficient and the given price.Those people who are saying oneplus is bad, I do not agree. It gets the job done wonderfully."
"There are a lot of software bugs which actually makes the usage of the phone very irritating.1. The camera gets stuck most of the time. Especially when using the night mode. I have to restart the phone then.2. Making video calls in this phone is so irritating. After 5-10mins the call gets hung up automatically.3. Apps are getting closed automatically.4. The front camera is not at all great.Hoping OnePlus gets this fixed soon through software updates. I mean, this was not expected from a phone costing 30K."
"Mobile is heating up to 46- 48 degree , instead of eligible for replacement or return got extremely bad response from amazon customer care guys.In between replacement procedure amazon asked me to perform various performance test from blancco app, my many tests got failed still they didn't consider that and asked me to do retest .Also told me that they can't replace or return the device as it is working fine.I am having bad heating , connectivity , battery drainage  issues. still they refused to return/replace."

"Charging adaptor not working properlyHello sirI have purchased an oneplus mobile on 25 Jan, 2022 through Amazon. Recently i have got a charging issue with my oneplus adaptor. It takes much longer than usual to charge my mobile. It takes 10 to 15 hours to charge 60% of my mobile phone. Regarding this issue I have talked to Oneplus customer service center but they suggest me to visit the service center that is 200+ km far away from my place and the transportation charge will cost me more than buying a new adapter and my time will cost me much more. So I request you to consider my issue seriously and ensure the plausible satisfaction for your valuable customerI am attaching my invoice with this mail, please do consider ...Thanks"
I Bought one plus nord 25g two months ago . Suddenly display gets slowly slowly bluish and gets damaged..I have never came across this type of worst experience ..such a pathetic one plus phone...will never recommend this phone to anyone...
"I was very confused, while ordering this phone. As I was using Samsung S series phones previously. But honestly saying, I'm fully satisfied with this product. Good battery life. Good camera quality as I was expecting. And a decent look. Quite happy with this. I had ordered it on same day, when it was launched. Now I have used it more than a month. Fully satisfied."
"The Nord 2 is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1200AI processor and is available in 6GB, 8GB and 12GB RAM options. OnePlus offers 128GB and 256GB storage options but these aren't expandable further Just like other OnePlus smartphones, the Nord 2 also gets OxygenOS and it is running on top of Android 11. You also get two years of software updates and three years of security updates. The Nord 2 is a good performer and can handle heavy tasks and apps without any issues. The 4500mAh battery can go for a day and a half without any issues. Charging is super quick and the phone can get topped up from a drained state in just 32 minutes.  Camera performance of the Nord 2 is good for the price. Daylight photos are good but shots from the ultra-wide angle camera aren't great. The Nord 2 manages close-ups and portrait shots very well. Low light camera performance was also good and with Nightscape mode, the phone can click better shots in lowlight. Overall, the OnePlus Nord 2 is a good pick for someone on a budget."
"I have been using one plus 6 and that processor still beats up meditek 1200 very easily..Heats up easily.. Even small applications make it hot.. Think about heavy applications, that may make it burst easily. Experienced after replacing 2wice the same handset. Quite a disappointment from one plus."
"This review after 3 month useOverall performance : 4/5Camera : 4/5Fingerprint : 3.5/5Heating : 3.5/7For gaming : medium size gameDisplay quality : 4/5GPs Aquracy : 3.8/5Screen Touch feel : 3.8/5This phone 📱 value for money, for lightweight gamers, professionals,"
Finally done. after reviewing many reviews on Amazon n Google I have bought it and speed n performance wise it is awesome phone... Will edit other things which is required to mentioned till now I am more than happy with it...
"First impression - Really great and Worth the upgrade for 30k.I suggest don't go for 12GB variant.First thing I checked in the phone the 4G speed and carrier aggregation. It's really fast and able to get a max speed of 70+ Mbps using Airtel network.My previous phone were able to give only 40 max.Camera is nice . Worth for 30k.Even though it's 90Hz, you won't find any difference.Battery backup nice - I got around 9hrs of screen on time with average usage.Haptic feedback is really good.Display is awesome."
"Good to purchase, battery backup is good with normal usage but when used extensively it comes for around 12 hrs Max but since 65w wrap charger is provided it charges faster in 30mins to 100%Must have provided 120Hz refresh rate but 90Hz is often matchable.Didn't see any issues like heating, hanging till now.Oxygen 11 with color OS gives great UI experience.Camera quality is good when compared to other Nord phones and great wrt night image enrichment.With MediaTek Dimensity 1200AI Processor I feel fast access.Good phone to buy in this price range!!"
All specifications are best only one that is messing with us is call recording.when click to record during call the other side person get a voice notification of recording bcoz of google dialler.this is worst part.
"Hi Everyone,I Heard about ONEPLUS brand new phone i.e. one plus nord2 5G. I was so excited with the features 12GB RAM, 256GB memory and cost is only 35K. So I planned to purchase it. I ordered the phone on amazon and I received the phone on 1st September. After 3-4 days, I found the issue in the phone,The issue is ""When you call to someone, During the call, the network signal from both the SIM suddenly get disappeared and the call get breaks and after 10-15 seconds the network appears again. I have faced the same issue multiple times, when you call to someone and during important conversationwhen the call get break, The person on the other side also get irritated. I called one plus service centre, They said to troubleshoot the phone and guided me few steps that I have followed and still got the same issue so I called them again. They asked me to bring the phone on service centre or send it by courier for repairing. I thought courier service would take lot of time, So I preferred to go to the service centre which is 110km from my home. I planned a travel in the weekdays and go to the service centre. I am from Khandwa(M.P) and the service centre is in Indore. I reached the service centre after 5 hours of travel. They asked me to take backup of items in phone and comeback after 3-4 hours, When I went back they said the issue is resolved, I was so relaxed, After 10 hours of travel in a day, It was so hectic. Finally I reached home at 1:00 AM. Next day I called through my phone and the same problem happened again. It was so frustrating and I had no idea, What to do now, I again called the one plus customer care, while calling customer care also the call got break, I was not able to talk to them properly. It was so frustrating to call them again and again and complaining the same issue. One day I sent an email also to the Europe region and explained them everything then I got a call from Bangalore region from customer care centre. While I was talking to them also and trying to explain my problem the call got break and I was not able to make call back to the same customer care number. I Handle lot of my work through phone and the primaryfeature of any phone is calling, If it is not working then there is no use of phone. I requested to customer care multiple times to replace it, they said they can't do it,Then I sent my phone through courier service on 26 October 2021 and then called the customer care to get updates of my phone, they said the repairing is in process, it will get back to me soon.Today also I called, now they are saying they haven't looked out the phone yet due to multiple holidays, The customer care people giving different answers Now, I don’t have any option other than waiting for my phone. I REQUEST TO THE PEOPLE WHO READ THIS POST, YOU MAY ALSO SUFFER THE PROBLEM THAT I AM FACING. I know that it happens with 5% customer but you may come under 5% people.PLEASE BE AWARE OF USING ONEPLUS BRAND PHONE.Thank you for reading this post."
"Mostly 2 devices are got blast till Sept 7th, 2021. Life is not a joke and don't take it as easy.More over I have observed only 2 defects.1) Alexa not built in this divice2) Headse connector is C typeI am using this mobile from past one month still observing the performance."
please don't go with Youtuber video reviews because..before some days i buy nord2 because every Youtuber says this is valuable but don't say this device with lacking problem..you are use your 5 to 10 app and suddenly you lock your device then some time after you are reopen and try to use your nord2 that time device slower ..then you are removed your all app to background then its working normally.that's problem i have face so i return my device
Not working have some problem when I play ▶️ after few seconds phone automatically power off I have lots of problems I have submitted online report to OnePlus customer care but not slow my problems Worst phone of my life.... It is such a buggy phone... Lots of bugs are there... Even battery also drains too fastBugs:-1) if you hide fotos it will make hidden folder in file explorer and then once you unhide them you cannot hide them again from file explorer now how to hide man2) If you are playing music and suddenly want to listen to recording in whatsapp it will not stop your music both will play together3) selecting and deselecting of photos sometime I try to select it get deselected I try to deselect it get selected4) on lock screen if you double tap it should ask for finger print sometime it happens n sometime notIts been only few days I am using it will find more n update... Waste of money... Never suggest nyone to buy
"Firstly I had vivo Y91 before this which was quite avg phone with minimal features.So, this is my first OnePlus phone.Pros1) Runs smooth AF at 90 fps.2) Fast charging (25-30 minutes) and good back up too.3) Comfy in hand4) Good gaming experience but not the bestCons1) Overheating issue is unbelievable. If u play PUBG at ULTRA HD graphics the temp reaches 44°. But HDR is good (yet heating issues exist but not as it happens at ULTRA HD)2) Camera isnt any good. You get 10× zoom but as you zoom into 10× the picture becomes like it's in graphic mode or something or Maybe I don't know the how to rectify it. (Someone help me if u guys know about it)Overall not 'the best phone'. Kindly if u are hardcore gamer consider OnePlus 9 series. And paying 30k and this is the Camera OnePlus offers really disappointed.Also, if your looking for a good phone and not brand name (specially gamers) consider other phones which offer better experience with best prices.If you are really wanting to buy OnePlus wait for OnePlus 9RT it can be better at low price.3.5/5 overall."
"So, Battery is good! Camera is great!! Display and speakers are just mind blowing¡!! Only issues i have discovered so far after using it for a week is that the screen glitches. Whenever I open amazon music, I can see certain lines appearing on my screen and they disappear again... also I was kind of expectating more options for personalization of my display or phone in all. The front camera is good... I hope the screen glitches will be fixed after the next update."
This doesn't have any distinct features for its price but it checks all the right boxes. I would have loved if I got a more brighter 120hz screen. I miss my good old headphone jack.Camera is good but not the ultrawide sensor.Career aggregation for 4g+ is working.I didn't find any bugs in this version of Oxygen Os (they got solved in updates).Final talk: I still feel I paid more for this device compared to competition.
"3 months after purchasing, the phone has started heating up like crazy. It's not even like I'm using some heavy duty apps. Reddit, Wikipedia, whatsapp. The usual ones. No games. The phone heats up and drains battery. I'm falking like from 70% to 15% in 20 mins. Useless phone. Please avoid."
"It's a sub standard phone as compared to previous one plus phone experience. The software is not smooth and have heating issues. I am not happy with this phone. Display is good, Sound is Ok, and typing is good, Battery is decent, Front camera is below average and rear camera is good in daylight and night both. UI is good. The phone is not responsive enough.  Only take it of you want a brand value phone. I was not expecting this from OnePlus."

 Used one plus  3 t, 5,6t & 7 also headphns of OnePlus.. but hd worst experience this tym. Ordered 8gb 128 ROM. After cloning data of 33gb out of 128 gb.. the phn get hanged and start blinking. None of application was working. Nothing to display on screen. Even after visit of IT  services Team of one plus still hving d same prblm. Bad experience.. very disappointing"
"The best midrange Oneplus smartphone till date! Been using the phone for 2 weeks now & the things which i loved about the device is1. Flagship Camera (Sony sensor)2. Performance ( Great Processor with AI integrated)3. Brilliant Connectivities ( Wifi 6 & storage 3.1, 7- 5G bands)4. Design & build qualityThe battery is not bad at all, it last for a day easily and it charges the device 0-100 in just 33 minutes (That's impressive)Overall a great purchase, would recommend for people who are looking for a oneplus midrange smartphone with great camera, performace & design."
"Safety issues regarding battery charging. Already two phones exploded. Better avoid and look for alternatives. My phone is okay as of now, UI is good, camera is over hyped. Battery lasts almost 1.5 days comfortable with normal use. No games. Warp charge is good.Just scared now with battery"
My review in numbers out 5⭐Display -5⭐Audio quality -4⭐Loudness -5⭐Main Camera -5⭐Wide Angle Cam -3.5⭐Telephoto (2MP) Cam- 0⭐Front Camera -4⭐Charging -5⭐Build Quality -4⭐Processor -4⭐Price -4⭐Overall 4.5⭐Probably the best phone in segment
"Earlier I was using MIUI , so now oxygen OS feels like heaven.Below are my pros and cons in comparison with the phones of similar price range.Pros:1)looks2)fast charge(65w warp charges phone 100% in ~35 min)3)good rear camera4)lot of 5g bands(7)5)value for money6)good speakers7)dual 5g supporting sim card slotsCons:1)battery drains a bit faster as it has only 4500 mah capacity2)should have give 120hz refresh rate, but 90hz is decent enough3)absence of 3.5mm headphone jack4) non expandable storageOverall it's a very good oneplus phone for this price."
"Charging speed 10/10Battery drain normal use 9/10Batter drain while hotspot on 1/10Batter drain while gaming in non HDR mode 8/10Cellular coverage over wifi call 9/10Cellular coverage in normal network 4/10Wifi connecting is perfect ,but while you are away from wifi range it will still connect to the same wifi name and do not use the mobile data until you switch the wifi off some times, this is a bug of Oxygen OS may be.If you are looking for some normal usage phone with a fast charging speed and you do not use hotspot much, this is good deal.Else this is not recommended at all .RegardsVivek mahobiya"

 Honest review- it's a satisfactory phone.While using Map I opened video and while recording it is laging and I can't believe this its happening in 1200 dimensity chipset which is used in oneplus. However we buy oneplus phone for lag free or hang free. So I m attaching that video so u people can see nd decide it where u have to purshace it or not.....Be careful for ur hard earned money guys."
"Mobile looks awesome and build quality is great. Fast charging and good camera.But the fingerprint reader is not upto the mark, it doesn't read my fingerprint properly sometimes.Battery drains too fast. Even if u keep it idle, battery drains automatically. I am not a gamer or don't use camera too much, still it's getting discharged on it's own.Also there is some heating issue. When you video call for more than 30mins, phone gets bit warm."
"I bought 12gb ram version 8-9 months ago, phone has exponentially deteriorated in past 2 months. The phone has so many bugs.some of the bugs are :- Unable to use internet over wifi, there is lag between recieving call and ability to accept the incoming call, random call drops, camera shuts down randomly, picture in picture mode of apps is buggy and many more.Also I have a pretty minimal usage of my phone during a day. Maximum on any day my on-screen time goes upto 5 hours.  I have been forced to change my phone. This was not expected from OnePlus. My previous phone was OnePlus 5t and I was in love with that phone."
"It's been 3 days since I am using it,it's amazingAmoled screen gives u flagship experienceSpeakers are as good as a tv or music system speakersCamera gives super clarityBattery backup is amazing it runs 24 hrs without any need of charging,I used for YouTube,browsing,music etc65 w warp charger is simply superb within 15 min it charges 50% which is enough for 1 day,30 mins it takes for 100% chargingWe can't get this much quick charger in any other mobile in this rangeOnly small issue I faced is while closing the open apps,the bottom button has to be slided which sometimes don't respond, which I think we can learn over period of time. One plus can look into some simpler way for itOverall superb phone go for it,I migrated from iPhone 6s still liking this one"
"I bought this phone a month back and after using it , i would recommend not to buy ...this model of 1+ is a failure .it hangs a lot even after recent update .....waste of money ....buy the Hire versions of 1+ .Main issue is with sharing of data via whatsapp and telegram. Even though I have 12gb+256gb , it's not fluidic. May because of Mediatek processor ....should have gone for snapdragon...."
"Ordered it within 5 mins of launch.Just go for it...best 30k you will spend.Its fast, clean, beautiful, handy and one of the better camera out there.On screen finger print scanner super fast and convenient.Con : Only thing I can think of is, it feels lighter. It has glass back so I expected it to have more weight"
"Brightness is very low while watching streeming content and watching videos, slefi performance is poor and back side camera ok and failed to capturing quality pics(detail on pics ) heavy  battery consuming , actually RAM IS 8 GB BUT INTERNALLY IT USING ITSELF  AROUND 6GB , AND ONLY AVAILABLE RAM IS  2 GB ONLY, ONLY BRAND IS ONE PLUS, BUT NOT PERFORMANCE WISE ,WHILE I PURCHASING ONE PLUS MY EXCEPTATIONS ARE VERY  HEIGH,  ONCE GETTING PHONE OVERALL EXCEPTATIONS GONE ,FINALLY THIS MOBILE GOOD FOR MOM AND DAD,"
"I am not a gamer but as a moderate user,i am writing thi review after 10 days of use OnePlus Nord 2.Overall phone is decent.Battery life is good as i used 10-12 hrs for continue use,fast charging is pretty good. Screen refresh is so smooth.Rear camera is unbeatable but front camera is disappointing as it is marked 32mp.A little bit heat during charging but after charge it cools down very fast and no heating issue during operation.I've my rate as 4.8 out of 5."
Pros**Top notch quality phone by 1+ **Hardware and software experience is unavailable . normal using on 90Hz refresh rate I got 9h 21min screen on time.ConsMinor heating issue on heavy using means heavy heavy using otherwise no problem at all
"I have been a loyal customer to Samsung since 2011, I have changed 4 mobiles in this period, and all were Samsung,  this was the 1st time wherein I switched to ONE+, it's been 6 days my mobile started heating slowly even at idol condition, and the battery started to drain rapidly, such a worst experience buying oneplus,I regret completely switching my brand, I recommend not to buy this product , one plus haven't engineered this particular model properly,"
"This is my first one plus phone and probably the last one as per the experience.I was using Xiomi phone but it was working way better than this one plus phone.Nord 2 has 3 main issues,1. Battery life - In the night when I am not using the phone battery drops 10% and even with the normal usage during day battery will last only 4hours.Any phone of 10-15k INR will work better than this.2.Camera - 32MP front camera is like 16MP camera. Back camera is not able to focus on objects really well.With Color Os, One Plus is now Oppo Plus.You will not be able to see much difference between Oppo's phone and the One Plus's phone.3. Heating Issue - Even with the normal usage and during charging phone will heat to next level.Hope One plus will come up with the update for Battery life atleast."
"Compared with one plus 7 -Performance - refresh rate is fast, faster mobileScratch - one scratch on top of mobile body which is made of Steel, colour fade. But I can ignore this.Camera - low light shots click awesome, images are sharp, selfie & it add white shade in back & front camera normal mode.AI feature in camera - if you are in low light it will start flash, auto detect camera mode.Sound - good to hear like playing something on speakers but it's phone.Instagram & hot start videos - I seen some videos looks blurr. But I checked with one plus offical mobile release video. It's looks correct to me.Charging - in 20 to 30 mins it will get charged.Cost - if one plus give it in 25000 then it's best mobile in market. But it's good as new features you received.Best in market for such price. I would suggest don't buy mobile higher than 30k. This is good for people looking for 20k to 30k."
"It worked well for one week. Nothing great in phone as such. But this phone gets restarted every now and then while using the phone. Hopelessly irritating, bought on 1st day and this my my 1st one plus phone and going to be last too..can someone help me with refund..."
"You must read this review.यह रिव्यू आपको जरूर पढ़ना चाहिए।I thought this phone to be a good camera phone. But the camera of this phone is not good as I expected. Front camera is average.  I compared it with my Redmi Y1 , then I got the result of Redmi Y1.  Redmi Y1 selfie better than oneplus nord 2. The details of the OnePlus Nord 2 were more better. But Redmi Y1 skin tone is very good. I don't know it's a bug or reality of oneplus nord 2 camera ? But I'm facing this problem from 30k camera phone. I don't expect this from oneplus.Pros of oneplus nord 21. Charging speed very fast2. Performance is very good3. Design4. Daily use experienceCons of oneplus nord 21. Selfie camera is average like 16k price range smartphone.2. Main camera is very bad i don't know why. ( for human subject photography skin tone is very bad )3. Battery backup is not good. battery drain every 1 hour to 1% average not fixed without using the phone.For your suggestionBakwas camera quality from 30k price rangeMujhe nhi pata ye bug hai ya fir camera esa hi hai me ye problem face kar raha hoon or mene return karna chaha ise toh replacement kar rahe ye log return nhi le rahe haiSo carefully purchase this device from your own risk."
"Low light selfie sucks. The 50 MP rear camera is limited to 3:4. Good Video stabilization on movie mode and other videos. I'm not satisfied with night selfies, the picture quality is so poor and blurry. When we apply any filter on portrait mode let's say the black and white filter, it not producing proper images. The pixels around the hairs are cracking, it's not smooth. And the Battery life. It is so good. Fast charging makes your life lot easier. Performance wise I have never faced any issue, I have been using Nord2 for 1.5 months. It's great experience except the camera issue. I can rate 4/5 (that one star gone because of low light selfie and the portrait filters).But Enduko naaku, theete leshi konna anipinchindi phone. 30 velu mari."
"First time purchased OnePlus and very disappointed over its frequent app crash specially camera app. Selfie camera also captures blank pictures if you preview after taking picture, then you have to restart phone. Not expected from such expensive phone.Performance and Wifi is Good. Battery Charging is superb.Request One Plus to fix bugs asap."
"I've been using this phone for 2 months now and I'm happy 2ith how quickly it charges and one recharge can get u thru the day, even if you're using it constantly. Sound wise it's great, the dirac tuner on earphones is great. But, camera has some issues with capturing skin tones I'm a Lil darker in complexion but still it makes me look pale, selfie camera is also horrible, but it has great night camera. The fingerprint, os, display and all are great."
Oneplus nord 2 is in the news again as one more phone explodes in India.. I bought it last month. I requesting to oneplus replace with any other model..
"Phone is decent but not great. I have been using this phone for about 6 months now and here is my experience.Phone is good for day to day tasks but if you are looking for a performance oriented phone, then this is not the one.My phone started lagging after 5-6 months of use. I have to  permanently enable high performance mode to use it fluently. Otherwise phone straight up lags. And using high performance mode constantly causes the battery to drain faster than usual.Camera is decent and it does the job.Finger print is also good, the only thing is that it doesn't work if you are trying to unlock your phone outside under the sun in bright day light. It's optical sensor so I think it makes sense."
Well this one definitely looks good brand value is good. But in my view the device should cost not more than 20k. Did not feel a wow factor except its charging which is amazing. Stereo sound is cheap like a low budget phone. I am not a camera user so no comments on that.  3 star is enough for the device.
"So there are better chipset mobile available in same price bracket, the value this phone creates is exceptional. The optimisation with Oxygen os is flawless buttery smooth, then the size is perfect coz I like to browse with one hand and it was perfect coz the width has been given due consideration.Now battery back up is a bit weak for heavy user but I charge for 15 mins and it's good to go.I was using latest iPhone max model couple of months back but that was too wide and I feel this phone's smoothness can be comparable to iOS, iOS winning just by minute differenceCamera is good but not great please don't compare with iPhones picture, but it is generally good, night mode is excellent.If you love android devices you cant go wrong with this phone, But if you are gamer I would suggest there are other option, this is like an overall package for a wider audience."
"Good look and feel. But obviously the product has impact from oppo. One plus fonts are gone. Icons from one plus is gone. It's more like an oppo phone. When I tried to update the software, it was showing messages in Chinese. Overall an ok phone with good camera."
"To keep it in silent mode you have to use side button and there is no option in phone, just like Nokia in 90s. For call acceptance or rejection there is only one option if you swipe up acceptance and if you swipe down rejection, it would be always better to give 2 separate buttons.There is no audio jack and you to go with wireless headphones. The UI is too pathetic looks like it was designed 15 years back. The only good thing is battery life and quick charging. There is no special in this phone. 5k or 6k phones are better than this and they are more options in good looking UI. My suggestion is don't go for this and waste your money. 35k is too much and not worth even 5k."
"I am reviewing after 7+ months usage.This phone is downgrading the performance with the age, especially the camera, when I got this phone camera was amazing, now it is not the same, the camera quality is very bad now,Phone multitasking is became average, I don't do gaming so for me it is performing well.Many minor bugs are still visible.But one great pros I can say was the battery life and charging time, it is still the same, the battery performance is top notch and fast charging is still working as good.Overall , a decent average phonewith great battery and charging support. Remaining all are average like how other smartphones has"
"A phone worth buying!Camera quality: It is the best I've seen. Even the diehard fans of other high end phones were impressed with the clarity of the photos clicked from this phone.Battery life: It has a very good battery life added with the warp charging, it is second to none.Even though it lacks some features like extendable memory and 3.5mm jack, it makes to it with other features."
"This is the worst segment of One Plus till date. I bought Nord 2 in month of August 2021, Since, then i was literally crying to waste my money on this handset. I do have trust on ONE Plus, hence I ordered this handset from Amazon. B"
"Nord 2 ticks all the boxes in terms of specifications. You can get Dimensity 1200 for quite a less price, but not the build quality and UI experience. Have been using this for the past week and have still not faced any issue with the device.Display is HDR10+ and is sufficiently bright outdoors. But the battery drains very swiftly if Video enhancement modes are on.Battery lasts you 12-14 hours on medium to high usage on full charge. The phone gets fully charged in 35-40 minutes.Camera is quite good. Only A52 4G has OIS in this range. Night shots are particularly very good because of OIS. There is Gyro EIS for videos also, which renders very stable videos. Wide Angle Camera is not so great, but gets you clear images.Oxygen OS 11.3 has now few features from the Color OS ( Camera UI and some changes in settings ), which is a good thing in my opinion as Color OS has pretty good customisation options. UI is nearly stock.The device has no IP rating but is splashproof and the sim tray has rubber protection.Device has only two cons - It has no 3.5 mm jack and you do not get connector in the box. The other is that the device is quite slippery because of the frosted glass back ( Grey Sierra  )."
"The phote heats up sudeenly and to such a extend that you feel the burning sensation.Phone software is also not so smooth, it lags, specially when you wanted to pick a call, you have to literally tap the phone twice or thrice.Phone battery is something you have to worry and need frequent  feeding.This review is a genuine post and you can trust !!!"
After using it for 10 days ... only issue I found was Heating issue...it gets heated only after after playing hectic games for around  1 hour or so . Biggest plus point is its camera ..it capture beautiful picture. And one more thing I would say is its biometric is at the bottom of display which I liked the most.
"I had been using RN4 for 5 years.Although the phone was in usable condition, i badly needs an upgrade. So i purchased OPN2.i have been using this phone for one week.i will express my candid view about the intial experience.PerformanceFirst of all, MT1200 chipset is a pretty good one.on day to day life experience it works really smooth.thanks for the 90 hz display.it also facilitate to obtain a smooth experience.i have found some glitches on youtube..may be it is a bug.. waiting for the future upadtes to solve this minor issue.other than that i got a smooth experience.BatteryIn battery department i must say this phone is a beast.with the 90 hz display it managed to give a 8-8.30 screen on time.in terms of charging speed it charges super fast  within 35 minutes. 65 w charger works really well.CameraIn this department im not completely satified.camera and athe sensor is too much capable to take good pics. But camera app and software algorithams need polish and is not well optmised at all.back camera works good, but really wants to rely on luck factor.portrait mode is really disappointing one.actually i tried gcam and it gave me some really good portraits. But mt1200 chip is not well optimised for that,so that the app runs really slow.i appreciate front camera.it will give you a natural look and pretty much details in some clicks. But some pics  were washed out and are not completely reliable.media consumptionI completely satisfied at this area.90 hz amoled display will give you a soothing experience.movie experience,youtube playback anything you throw on this department is nearer to perfect experience. That dual sterio speaker is actually really loud and well seperate.In short i found this phone is worth the money.although it has some minor problems."
Phone is lagging after 3-4 days of light use. Even I'm not installed any game in my phone. But phone is hanging.
The phone is a good one. The only problem is the battery life. Battery drains so fast. If you turn on the hotspot or location battery drains almost same speed of the charging.
"I had purchased first one plus 3 phone, which has excellent features and camera quality, later I  had purchased one plus 5t, which too has excellent camera picture quality, however when I saw the picture quality of one plus Nord 2 5g, it is not as good as provided by my previous one plus smartphones, and I totally regretted the purchase of the same. I recommend not to purchase this phone by seeing less price, compared to  one plus 9. As they with price, they compromised the quality also...Instead u can go for any other OPPO or VIVO phone which will give you better picture quality and features at a lesser price than one plus....."
Bought one plus nord 2 instead of nord CE because of camera review was good.... But to my disappointment camera quality is not so great...Camera clicks brighter pictures... Night photos quality is goodMajor issues with battery draining faster while using internet also heats up little while chargingCharging is faster which cope up tiny bit of faster battery draining problemOne plus team needs to work on battery draining issue
All is well
Overall a good phone. Camera needs improvement as the color in the snaps seem over saturated. May be the future updates will improve the camera performance. No issues with mobile data network and wifi reception/speed.
Honest Review.1. Back camera is perfect while 32MP front camera little bit blurry. I didn't like the front camera but back camera is perfect.2. Battery 🔋 is good with first charge. It's really takes 30 mins to full charge.3. Design is awesome with glossy back look.4. Fingerprint reader is little bit slower.5. Sounds like great with stereo.Overall not best but good in 30K.By RK.
As this phone is much costly compare in market. Still I have purchased it on behalf of OnePlus but I'm disappointed like not good camera quality even 50mp just like 12mp even front camera is good and about battery also average. And main problems is heating the mobile.  Personally I would suggest don't buy this phone
Battery life good fast chargering quick. Camera best click photo video nice. Internal storage memory extra large.external memory card not use inside phone. pattern lock swipe no.headphone plugin point no adapter use. Worth value money.advance features updateds .play video audio good.user friendly
"It is smooth and looks amazing ,haven't found a single issue till now, 5 star is not justified but neither 4 star , 4.5 is my score 120hz could have made this a champ ut honestly speaking it doesn't matter,games like pubg,Asphalt are running without a single frame drop, don't listen to people who defaming OnePlus,they did full justification to OnePlus nord 2 ,just excpet 120hz ,buy it mahn you won't regret"
"Using this device from the last 15 days.Missing 120hz display, no stereo speakers, fingerprint sensor not fast, camera not that much satisfactory. I think I have to compromise in a lot of major things.This device has dimensity 1200AI and 3.0GHZ primary clock speed, but couldn't feel that high performance during gaming or any process. Gets heat up in normal usage sometimes and the battery still drains (looks like this device contains about 3000mah battery)"
"Pros: It looks good, camera quality is also good.Cons: It heats on normal usage.Battery life is also on lower side.Display refresh rate is just 90 hz (in this range almost all mobile comes with 120 hz)."
"OnePlus is no longer the OnePlus we knew. The Oppo'fication of OnePlus has already begun and you can feel it. It's still a good phone tho. But for people who loved oxygen os and it's clean and near stock experience, this one's going to be a massive disappoinment. I've been facing quite a lot of bugs here and there as well.Apart from that this thing has great battery, great charging speed and a very good main camera. Ultra wide sucks and so does the selfie camera. Display is good. Haven't faced any perfomance issues as of yet.PS: writing this after 2 weeks of usage. Don't know what the future holds for this OnePlus Nord 2"
"If you are looking for a phone to play games like pubg , BGMI ... And you can trust this phone ,Game won't lag , It runs smooth in higher settings as well , fps doesn't drop ...Pro gaming mode is really good .Also the camera is Gud under this price .Plus you gets many bands of 5g in this , so you don't have to change the phone for a couple of years or may be more ."
"Touch sampling rate is lower than mid range phones at 120 hz and you notice it while using it.. they used low quality display, it has low brightness than nord 1 and CE. We can not find these things as they dont mention it anywhere and we expect good display and touch experience at this price point. They purposefully lowered the performance of the chipset, this phone scores lower benchmark than any other phone with same SOC- DC1200."
"It's 12.29 am in the night and I am reviewing it right now after my 1 day of full usage, I charged my phone at 10.00 am yesterday and it's still 54%. I use to use iphone 8, and the battery use to drain out at 6-7 pm daily based on my usage. With the same usage I still have 54% battery left. I was a still worried with only 4500 mah battery but the result my phone has shown due to its processor and Ram is simply unbelievable. I have become. Fan of one plus after using my Nord 2.Diplay is awesomeBattery and Charging is fantasticLooks - It's One Plus. Brand is upto its mark.I will update my review after 15 days of usage.Review after 15 Days of usage.All above points still continue...."
"I'm writing this review after a month of use , the product is ok however it's overpriced for the specific range with average features. Camera is just ok but not much perfect and looks sometimes animated or over beautified. Battery life is perfect and an average product for high cost !"
Oxygen os was best. But now mixing of color os is with some bugs. Camera quality is not expected range  and google dialer + messsge are not good for oneplus mobiles. Oneplus dialer is best with auto call recording. Google dialer is totally wast due to auto call recording function in its very worst.
"I have oneplus 6T and this device was for my brother.The only one issue in Oneplus devices is its slow-mo video quality..Its blinking in slow-mo in just the little darkness.While in store, they have too much light in the store so that's not easily get flickering. But in the little darkness, not a good.."
"I'm writing this review after using this phone(Oneplus Nord 2) for one month.Camera: Decent(4 stars)Refreshing rate: Good (4 stars)Battery Life: If you are turning your hotspot and playing games for a longer time then you have to charge the phone 2 times a day. But, the charging speed is too good and it'll take a maximum of 40-45 mins to get 100% charged (3.5 for Battery life and 4.5 for charging speed)Gaming experience: Decent (4 stars)Heating: Didn't experience it yet. You'll feel slightly warm if you use the phone for >2 hrs continuously.Fingerprint / Face Recognition lock: swift(5 stars)The best option for regular use."
Pathetic phone. I bought the 12Gb version and it has so many issues. All video apps fail to render video many times. One can bear sound but no video. Even app restart does not work. Sound controls are not as fine tuned. My one plus 5 bought 6 years ago works better than this piece of junk. Can't even return it now as return window has passed.
"I got the phone on same day as i ordered. Thanks for the amazon for quick deliveryNow comes to the phone.1) first impression of the phone was very good.2) display is vibrant and good.3) Serious issue with the fingerprint sensor. It is not working as expected. replacement for the phone is on the way.4) Camera quality is good.Today, I got the replacementThis phone is working fine. No issue with the fingerprint sensor."

Though phone quality is good but I am not impressed with overall quality of Camera and other features.Same quality we get half price from other brands.Not received the color which I selected without any offer.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Main camera is just superb. Never saw such low light photos taken with any smartphone 👌Video is super stable thank to the OIS.The phone is buttery smooth, you can run any game.Battery life is good, charging is just great..A happy user 😊"
"Good phone in every aspect, a complete package, initially I was confused between oppo reno 6 or one plus, Finally i stick to one plus as its offering was better as compared to oppo reno 6.Media tek 1200 processor, no lagging, excellent performanceCamera is also good both back and front, colour are not over saturated look more natural.Battery performance is also pretty good with one charge lasting for 2 days with light use and 1 day with heavy use.Looks good, handy, easy to operate, value for money."
"Worst phone I have ever bought.I bought for camera and use for zoom meeting. On every 2 to 3 seconds the phone gets freezed in zoom meeting. I called helpline (?), they arranged for enginer (?) visit, He observed the problem but reported wrongly  that phone is ok. I again contacted helpline(?), again they arranged another visit, but he was same expert engineer (?) , but he did not visit at all. So there is no helpline from amazon,once you purchase anything, they will not help you, only they will listen you. So before buying anything from amazon think twice or better buy from local store at least he will be helping you in product problems."
"this is really one of the best phones of 2021 so far, let me very first talk about UI of stock android which literally makes you look at this diva again & again!! performance is smooth like butter, no lagging or glitching at all & another best thing is how this device feel in hands!! PERFECT!! battery life is outstanding i literally used my phone for more than 24 hrs & one of the great thing is it's battery charging speed is beyond way!! it charges your phone upto 70 % in just 10 to 12 min!! i mean what a BEAST it is!! Always wanted to have ONE PLUS device but never bought because of their high prices BUT this time one plus have really cared for budget friendly people & introduced to this FLAGSHIP KILLER DEVICE ❤️WELL DONE ONE PLUS!!"
"If u want battery backup, go for it... Gets full in 20-30 min, on moderate use, lasts 1.5-2 days...  But camera is getting worst and worst on software updates... OnePlus needs to fix this... Also bugs r increasing.... I suggest go for 9R or others"
OnePlus is not more like before..after update .. sometimes phone restart automatically.. sometimes navigation buttons and keyboard not working but after restart the phone it working again..after 15 days of using the phone my data cable not working so I have to purchase another cable because in my area service center is not available.. please fix this by software update..and try to expand service center in India..thanks
I bought 12gb 256gb phone. Phone is very good but battery backup was pretty less. If your usage are heavy then 4-5 hr max. I have to charge mobile twice in a day. If they charging 35k then atleast work on battery optimisation. Samsung is better in battery life very long lasting battery.Pros:Camera was good.65W Fast charging.Cons:Battery life is poor charging phone twice in a day.Added colour os which is not good.Phone brightness also very low in day light not properly visible.
Purchased the phone on 1st sale. Writing this review after using the phone for 15days.1) Performance 10/10. No lag issues. I am not a gamer.2) Main camera 9/10.3) All other camera 6/10. They are average. Selfie lover should ignore this phone completely. They will get better device at this price range.4) Charging 10/10. Nailed it !!!5) User Interface 10/10. As it is my first onePlus phone so I am not aware what impact it had created after merging with colour OS. It is clean and I have not faced any problem.6) Dual speaker with amazing sound. 10/107) Headphone jack Missing. You are going to miss a lot if you are not used to it.Wish oneplus increases security updates from 3 to 4 years minimum like Samsung has done for its mid range devices and register this device under google Android enterprise program.
I have never written a review before but I am trying to write for this one so the biggest Con I will start with Con because it's the most important thing for me and I think it will be the most important thing for you who are reading this is that the battery is aweful it will need tobe charged at least twice in a day with very minimal use of the phone I don't do any gaming I don't even use my phone a lot I am a laptop person but still I have to charge my phone twice in a day so I can't think of the people who play games and who rely heavily on the phone it is not feasible for someone who have a field job and I will say that other than this front camera is also very Aweful but the back camera is awesome it takes good photos in low light also overall the functionality of phone is good the phone doesn't get  heated it get warm while charging so I don't think all these explosions and everything is true maybe it's true but I think it's  may be just one off case not for everyone. so it's a good phone but I think the most important thing in any phone is the battery because all the apps all the RAM all the GPS gets only used when you have the battery right so here that's my review. Apologies for no punctuation I wrote this using text to speech feature.
"This phone is the best in this segment. Firstly, to clarify against others reviews. My phone doesn't heatup, I don't face any lag issues, battery doesn't seem to drain and everything seems to be fine. if you guys are facing any of the above problems, probably you have received a defective product.1.Camera is good. Rear camera could have been better. Front camera is awesome.2. Display is really good. I don't personally see difference between 90Hz & 120Hz display.3. The phone doesn't heat. It gives out nominal heat any phone would radiate.4. Gaming seems to be smooth and you can play for one hour long and feel lil heat on phone.5. Battery seems to be great. I haven't faced any battery drain issues till now.6. Face unlock is pretty fast compared to other competitors.7. Dual speakers is loud but lacks the crispness in audio.Few things which could have been better:1. Rear Camera Software updates needed.2. UI seems to be a problem and few bugs are there. Can be updated in the future.3. Fingerprint sensor sometimes experience a lag. Updates could solve the problem."
"The phone is good i won't say it as great,the camera is too bad,i had a OnePlus 7 before , which was a model before 3years that camera is far better thn this one,if your looking for a good camera ,go for samsung,oneplus is not in the old standards anymore,gives VIVO kina cameras You know what i mean, For all the phone enthusiast out there this is not the phone you want if expectations of camera is high. NOT GOOD FOR YOU ONEPLUS. You will surely pay for this."
"Hi thr, here's my review after 15 days of use.I am a light user means I don't use my mobile on the heavier side..I just wanted a phone which feels good to hold, looks premium, good screen quality, good battery and camera...that's all.In this mobile I got all I need.Charging speed is awesome and with my usage one n half day usage is easy one. It gives almost 6-7 hours of screen on time..I would highly recommend this mobile. Thumbs up for one plus."
"ZERO RATING, I am trying to fix the faulty charger that I received, customer support guy talks like a recorder!  Can't help need to visit Services centre To fix that is one and half hour Travel one side!  NO PICK AND DROP Facility!  DON""T BUY.!!!!1000% NOT BUY recommendation"
"Got the Grey Sierra model on thr first sale. Here are my thoughts after 48 hours of usage-1. The camera- One word: Incredible. HUGE step-up from the previous generations and almost can go neck to neck with flagship cameras. The selfie camera is good too. Will update some photos after i take this phone outdoors. Wide angle camera is ok, nothing special. But the selfie camera is also great. There are some negetivity for hsing Oppo's camera app. But i see that as a great plus point. There's bokeh video, AI color focus and some portrait features only found on Oppo phones. And we know oppo is pretty good in cameras. And the night mode is outstanding2. Design and In- hand feel- Feels Solid. The grey Sierra model looks absolutely wonderful. Compact design and very comfortable to hold.3. Display- general 90hz amoled panel. But lack of HDR 10 support. Overall a good display.4. Haptics- An Absolute joy to type and engage with the phone. The haptics feel extremely premium. There is no buzzy motor.5. "" OXYGEN OS ""- Yes there are some color os elements in Oxygen os, but it still works and feels like one. Color os is not a bad UI at all, people who have used it know that. I've used Color Os 11 and it's pretty close to stock with some great personalization features. But still we want oxygen os to be oxygen os. If they take the good from color os there's no problem.6. Mediatek Dimensity 1200- from initial use the phone is extremely snappy and responsive. However from the benchmark scores this one scores a bit lower than the regular Dimensity 1200 devices. Maybe the reason being the higher clocked 3.0 ghz core is underclocked at 2.6 ghz, as per CPU-Z app. Maybe a software update can fix that if that was not unintentional.7. Speakers- Stereo speakers are loud. Although the bottom firing speaker is louder. 70% sound comes from that. 30% comes from the earpiece speaker. Overall a good experience.8. Battery and charging- the 6nm processor can hold on for a day and half. And you can always use the 65W charger, and it charges the phone Insanely fast.9. Verdict- Realme X7 Max and POCO F3 GT may seem like a better value for other people but the OnePlus Nord 2 provides all around performance from gaming to camera performance. Also the UI is such a plus point for this phone. 90hz is fine as a display, also helps in battery consumption. If you're not completely into gaming or if you have 30k budget, you can absolutely go for the Nord 2."
"I have been using this phone for 1 month but apart from camera nothing works well. Touch response and refresh rate is pathetic, this will never give you the premium phone feeling.Not justified to its brand value and price range.Go for other phone in this price range."
"Undoubtedly,The Most Value For Money Smartphone By OnePlus In 2021Slightly disappointed with product's box damageA summary review1)display quality could have been better considering the competition.Realme X7 Max,Iqoo 7,Even Poco F3 GT have better quality display2)sound quality is superb with good amount of bass and it's pretty loud3)haptics are stunning equivalent of their flagship OnePlus 9 Pro4) ergonomically,It's pretty well build5)the main primary sensor produces some good photos in daylight condition and lowlight photos are stunner meanwhile I am hugely disappointed with ultra-wide camera it's just average and the fact that there is no macro camera which is sometimes a handy feature.Selfies both in daylight and lowlight are superb and selfie videos are good too but sometimes it struggles to maintain exposure.Rear camera videos are very good with good mic quality6)Colour OS merger with Oxygen OS leads to some changes  in appeal of the UI but a sigh of relief,that there is no additional bloatwares or unwanted notifications or adds in the UIHoping that Oppo doesn't ruin Oxygen OS in the future and keeps the same approach as in Nord 27) Battery Backup is pretty good you will get 5:30-6 Hrs of SOT and Charging speed are superb easily within 30-35 your device will get fully chargedThis was my summary reviewTo know in detail about Nord 2Please Check My Youtube ChannelTECHORYX"
The overall review of the phone is excellent. But it also does have some pros and cons in which pros win with majority features but the cons are that with phone doesn't have an IP rating and it's quite the dark spot of OnePlus because in India we don't know when it rains or when we'll accidently drop it in water so that's the end with of cons and the rest come below the pros table. Hope OnePlus will add an IP rating in the lineup of their future phones.
Great phone at 30k price range super fast snappy buttery smooth performance camera is nice battery backup is nice jst there is only one drawback that is the outer frame which is not metallic it is a polycarbonate plastic it will get scratch over time
"Ordered during sale for rs.31,841,Received a faulty device the next day, requested for replacement, waited for nine days having paid the money but without a phone. No replacement was initiated by amazon, after following up for ten days, finally got my refund. Terrible experience"
"Coming back to Android after using ios for more than five years feels really refreshing. The display is fantastic. Watching videos on it feels so immersive. Surprisingly the speakers sound too good for my ears. Camera is great, too though I am not crazy about clicking photos and recording. Overall, the phone is great in its performance. It should satisfy the needs of many consumers."
Phone is good in package but now motorola edge 20 announced and game changedThis Nord 2 need battery Improvement and midiatech chipset is also not goodAll at the end Nord 2 is Decent smartphone
when you start using the phone it just get heated in it's initial use like you can make food on it and the main thing is when u get to know this issue in one day or another you just can't return this phone.. So the return policy is also a myth in Amazon and talking about the service it is not worth a penny..!!So please don't buy a phone from here please i request..!!
Phone is really good but seems to be bit over budget compared to the other phones in the market. Camera is good but not so impressive as well. Battery life is somewhat okay and same goes with the other features and hardware parts compared with. Good product but not great though.
"Phone looks and feels premium,Camera quality is amazing...Best phone for regular use,warp charging is game changer surprised to see phone getting charged with in 30 mins.... Don't know long term implications on battery due to this...But phone get stuck or goes unresponsive while playing games intermittently..Overall its a value for money phone....."
"Overall experience is very bad I am using it around a month and finally today I have to sell it by 25k only. Irritating me due performanc... Every time I have checked fb insta and other apps it's showing blank when we see reels video's.When we share any image it shows Bluetooth app 5 icons , fb 4 icons and other apps too multiple time ...Eeeeee too much irritating. And in this 30k price we are not expecting this worst phone from OnePlus.I have purchased 3 phone and every phone having same problems. When we use any app it suddenly stop and again we need open...it feels like oppo ,mi phone not expecting like OnePlus.When we try calling sudden hang and during using many times goes hang mode again need clear and start from scratch.Don't buy it's just wasting our money in this price we many nice option but I was go with OnePlus brand but it's totally worst....😭😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬"
Look - goodQuality - OkPhone lags even after latest updates and 8GB RAMPoor network IC - you will face call disruption/ difficultiesFeel like average phone and certainly not the feel of One PlusBetter to settle with other good phone than One Plus in this price range. I am not very happy with the overall performance.
"Excellent phoneJeher he ye phoneIPhone competition here.The camera is just amazing. Oxygen osThe phone just gets charged from 0-100% in 20min.I was just like , what!!!!!Dimensity 1200 is just op..Only the thing in which the phone lacks is battery life.Through my experience, the battery long for 6-7 hrs of continuous use.For gaming, it last ls for 4-5 hrs continuous.This is my first one plus phoneAnd I'm definitely over satisfied with itSo, just go for it.If u hv a budget of 30K."
"After waiting and thinking a couple of year finaly I purchased my 1st OnePlus smartphone after knowing that the experience of OnePlus is smooth like butter and bloatfree.But I things were not so easy.1. I love replying any messages on social media or whatsapp by just going in Notification panel.But here in Nord 2 it's a nightmere for me.Replying to messages notification panel was pathetic.Multiple keywords never worked so far (p, q and caps keywords).2. Finger print:-Below average. Multiple times not working.3. Battery Backup:- Not good.Battery drains so so fast.Overall not happy.Mainly bcz of floating widow didn't worked and finger print scanner.Submitted complaint on OnePlus community and OnePlus support. Haven't received any solution.Amazon done a lot drama in replacement/return. And got nothing.Pathetic service from Amazon (in this project) and OnePlus.Cannot trust these 2 organizations now."
"Guys if you are looking for Good Smart Phone with all Good features. One Plus Nord2 is one of the best phone available in india. Guys the best part is this phone get charged just in 30 min, Camera and Speaker Phone is awesome. Finger Print takes no time to unlock the screen. Batter last for 1.5 days. Means good for anyone who is good talkative. I love the camera quality it's just unbearable in this price. Guys I'll strongly recommend for this phone. We get 2 options for RAM 8gb and 12 gbans comes in 3 different color variants."
"But, they could have improved camera quality. I am not that satisfied with it.Seems battery drains fast…. Will have to observe for few more days as its delivered today only..Super duper fast charging.. charged my phone from 8% to 100% in 41 mins.Nothing much to say.."
"Honestly, I love this phone, it doesn't have the best battery life or performance or anything in particular but what it has is a good experience especially when you are just getting into 30k phone segment,The phone feels decently premium, UI is still better than all its competitors ( MiUi etc), battery backup is decent but it literally chargers in 30mins.( My friend has that poco which is 67 watts and still takes like 50mins to charge) and trust me this is really worth it, speakers are really good, front camera is avg to be honest but main back sensor is actually really good, This is the best phone you can buy if overall experience is what matters to you, if you neither want beastly performance is game or excellent camera just a really well rounded smartphone. Which was true in my case. And trust me its ample fast and has still decent cameras not flagship level but decent."
"Phone is below my expectation, heating too much even while talking, on videocall 2min is enough to feal the heat, if u like heat better go n buy a heater in cheap rate. Why waste 30k, only displays n touch givs good feal. In primary use phone's flop showI rejected this one."
Amazing phone. Camera is really good.Storage is good. Excellent phone to buy.I am rewriting this review after successful usage after 53 days.Phone is perfect. Just go for it.Charging is superb fast and it will not drain out fast if you know the tips and tricks to save the battery. Good one. No hanging issues.
"I have used OnePlus one and One plus 6.Overall the new One Plus Nord 2 - 5G is FINE as per the pricing.Camera feature is little better and battery life is good compared to One Plus 6.But after the Oxygen OS upgrade in One Plus Nord 2 5G, i am facing problems at times while playing any videos be it Amazon Prime, Youtube, Hotstar or Instagram Videos. Mobile gets completly slow and the video will be unable to play.I have to restart my mobile so that it can run properly.Is it a software glitch or some bug error?"
"*Problems with one plus nord 2*These are few of what we are going through,-Videos dont work often (be it hotstar, netfix or amazon prime nothing works until restart)-Apps crash often.-Selfie camera is pathetic (gives yellow shade all the time in room light)-Whatsapp video call gets disconnected while maximising most of the times.-Earphones connected via connector don't work at times, audio comes from speaker only.-Constant fear of phone blast (as we have got to know recently) hangs over our head, we have to let our phone cool down if it gets even little bit hot as we are not assured that nothing would happen.-After locking our apps through applock, we dont get to see the details of notifications. There should be an option if we would like to view our notification details or not if the app is locked."
"It is premium quality product from OnePlus unlike the other competitors in the same price range and I am fully satisfied with the performance and experience.Pros : Smooth UI and UX, Build Quality, Performance, Camera, Display, Battery Charging SpeedCons : 3.5 mm (but bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and quality is awesome), sometimes hearts (not much), storage is only 128 for 30kWriting review from my Nord 2 5g 8/128 GB ⚡⚡"
Worst product in this segmentPlz guys don't buy it's my personal experience.Camera quality is not upto markBattery performance 7-8 hoursPerformance is averageBetter than Nord but not satisfied with performance in this price.I think Samsung and Vivo phones under 25000 are better than Nord.
"Battery life is good and fast charge is awesome. It literally charges from 0% to 100% in less than 1Hr.Camera is good however in video mode if quality is not adjusted properly the video size is huge, for example 1:20min video size will be somewhere between 175-200mb. Other than that no issues with quality.Gaming performance is also good.Could not get the opportunity to try 5g yet but have tried using wifi-5 (device is compatible with wifi-6) browsing speed is awesome.Camera lense can get easily damaged, so have to keep the device upside down."

"It is my first Onepuls mobile. Performance, camara quality and fingerprint reader are perfect. Impressed with super fast charging but disappointed with fast battery drain out. This has to improve. With-in a day drain out 20% by normal usage. I don't know the situation, if i would have use 100% usage like camara, music and mobile internet."
Felt let down by the phone.  Battery life is average. Selfie just makes me look RED. Photos don't look natural.  Super hyped average phone. Don't buy without trying at a store.  Buggy phone.  It always feels hot.  Never felt so sad about buying a one +
"Full of bugs , nothing works , finger scanner in not working properly , phone blacks out after few minutes , service not possible as purchased from Amazon , strongly opposing this one plus nord 2 5 g , please save your money"
I have been using one plus 3 t for more than 4 n half year . thought would change it coz the display was getting damaged  from down so had to go 4 new .so saw the review n my budget .But this phone gets stuck every now n then it isnt the trademark product of one plus really bad experience
"1. In terms of browsing application mobile feels premium, it doesn't put external apps other then Google apps in ram.2. Front camera is Just ok ok, previously using mi A2 takes better selfies. Rear camera even worst when click on human subject makes whitish face, get 1 better shot out of 6. Camera is only for natural photography not for human subject3. Battery backup is good easily get one day in single charge, charge from 0 to 100 within 35 minutes4. Wifi speed is getting better than other phones,data speed also good due to having more supported bands5. Gaming experience is also good on this6. Con is mainly camera, doesn't put external apps in ram due to this multitasking not so good,poor ram management, apps are not present in ram7. This phone is good for those who don't uses much camera,only engage in daily activities like phone calls, messages, whatsapp, NetflixBattery charging is fastCamera quality very poorNot worth of 30k getting better option in market,go for Snapdragon processor phones"
"Review after 6 days.Not impressed early waited for it. Heats normally after continuous use more than 30 min.,front camera quality is very poor. For 12gb,256gb for such a high specification battery drains very fast not more than 8 hours a day. It takes almost 45 min to charge 100%."
"The camera of the phone is very good.  There is a problem with the phone.  The faster the phone charges, the sooner its battery drains and the biggest problem with this is that this phone heats up very quickly and is getting very hot and I have found a technical fault in this by pressing the power button.  The call gets disconnected.  Whereas I have kept this option turned off in the settings.  I complained to the customer care but they too could not tell the correct solution.So my opinion is this for this phone.*ऊंची दुकान फीके पकवान*"
"This is a real SMART phone with best features. Bought it for my daughter and she loved it for the amount of features it has, the memory space, the camera quality and fast processor."
"And I gotta say i am damn impressed by this phone.It is so good.The battery life is good , but you can't get bothered with that because , man it takes approximately 32 minutes to charge from 1 - 100 , which is so fast, like you could read a newspaper or take a bath or eat food and come back and see it's charged fast.The camera is also good.But th thing I like the most is the smoothness that i get when I use my mobile , like this is too smooth and good to use and also the storage is also a plus point.I gotta say , this is the best phone that a guy or a girl can buy to enjoy."
I am using 12/256Gb model  from last 8 months but from last 1.5 months I am facing the issue of Automatically exit from Apps and for 5-6 second all app fade away and Its appear again after 5-6 second.And its happens frequent. And most important thing is  that my phone have only 52Gb data out off 256Gb. This is very disgusting .I was the big fan of oneplus and using devices from last 5 years.But from when they go with Mediatek this is happening.and day by day this haven't focus on Quality.
"I've been using this phone for more then 1 month now. And here are some of the things I like about the phone and dislike...Good:-1. I really like the display. The blacks are really black. And also even in outdoors the screen is pretty visible.2. The processor is really good. If you're looking for a gaming device with good looks I would highly recommend this phone.3.  The design is really good and feels premium without the case...Bad:-1.The camera is not as good as I expected it... The colors and the software reminded me of realme which I didn't like at all. If you're really looking for a phone for taking amazing photos Everytime you click, it's better to go for a Google pixel 5A.2. No headphone jack... It may not seem much but this small feature always comes in handy.and I always end up"
"Worst camera quality, worst finger print sensor is opening with anyone's fingerprint.Battery is draining like anything without installing any apps.Major issue heating. really worst experience"
Recieved last week. Touch screen is not working fast. Multiple pic selection in watsapp takes so much time...also received the mobile with thin screen guard. Is any one facing same issue and recieved with screen guard. After two week mobile is totally hanged. Slow and heating heavily
"Within 2-3 hours of usage, battery is draining by 30%. And without any usage in night, 60% charge is getting drained."
"I ordered oneplus 12 gb 256 gb varient at 28th july and i received it within 48 hours... Now after 3 hours usage my reviews are following, i was using oneplus 6t since last 3 years and now i purchase this phone though exact review can be explained after a week use ... But phone is very very good.. don't think and just go for it.Pros- beautiful camera both front and rare 9/10- better display quality and looks - 8.5/10- professor is very fast and smooth"
Nice phone nice camera night mode awesome... price should had been less.. phone is heating up sometimes with 1 app also.. it really seems there is some issue ..just bit scraed my other phones never heated like this atleast with 1 app..Feels Battery 🔋 issues are there in OnePlus nord 2
"It was my dream to buy one plus mbl frm 3yrs.. finally I ordered it..I ws too too happy., But after using 1week I cn see the issue in battery , 0%to 100% with in 7 min...and it drain with in 3_4 hurs ,worst experience...

Requested for return it's been more then 8 days no one came ....and main I wanted to share mobile screen al bot working properly.. dear buyers kindly don't buy this mobile ..I felt like use mbl am using... totally Worst experience"
"Within a week's time of purchasing the phone, the battery charging point started showing problems, and after just 10 days of using it's not working at all. There is no support from Amazon and in the first place the product should not stop working within days of purchasing. It was a terrible experience."
Flagship camera sensorwith great OnePlus signature designIf you're not a hard-core gamer than you should definitely consider this phoneOxygen OS is still the same just few apps are changed with Color OS and there are extra customisation options from color osBetter than all nords out there
I really wait for this device from long time and finally I get this . It is really a good smartphone and performance is also very good.  I like it design which is awesome and the built quality is also very good. It takes 35 minutes to full charge. Camera is also very nice specially the night option in camera.
It's a sturdy and responsive phone. No complaint about its quality or performance. But recent news of its batteries randomly bursting is a cause of concern. The company must recall all the phones to address this issue.
"Sleek looking phone and can be used with one hand unlike some other phones. Reasonably priced. Express charging with good battery performance. Some office applications performance is not optimum though - especially outlook and teams, Slight lag on trying to open notifications."
"This is what I would say to all the fans of One Plus, never give any opinion from all your acquaintances to buy this phone.  because i was just going to get aaple's phone then some of my friends said that one plus mobile phone is same as aaple's phone so man took this phone but after taking this phone i am so upset that i have to get it all the time  It has to be taken with the charger.  And all the time there is a fear that if I use more then the battery of the phone may not run out, its battery lasts only 4 hours.  That's why my opinion to everyone is that never buy the phone of this company nor give advice to anyone to buy it.  I am the District Manager of Siddharthnagar district under a Government of India company working under the Digital India Project of the Government of India. Now I will also file a case of cheating against this company."
Its good phone. Good looking. And decent price as well. Camera quality is good but not as expected from OnePlus. Little bit improvement is required in quality. Practically Features and looks are almost same as OnePlus 9. But price difference is huge. If you have extra money then go for 9. otherwise...Its good deal.
"It's was my dream to use OnePlus, but very much unsatisfied and heartbroken with the product, The Phone has heating issue, in changing time and out door in noon Phone gets havey hearted, same time it's gets switch off, and biggest fall back is this phone has very low security system, one day my friend mistakenly give her fingertip on the sensar, Phone gets open got open, after that it's happened many more time, worst security system ever, i mailed 7day back OnePlus India team writing thus issue, but no response receive yet, i hope amazon team or OnePlus team take same action on this."
"Good hardware, fast charge is amazing, poor screen quality, very very poor OS, not a bad camera.After using for more than 2 months reduced one star, it has pathetic sound quality. I am a music lover and I hate music of this phone(specially it's speakers) feels like china phone with loud but low quality audio.Refer the buggy UI screen image"
"Phone is awesome, performance in every aspect, and mainly it's ui and ux.. oxygen os is really far better than any rom is used till now.. except stock android.. also the AI performance of phone is really great thanks to it's dedicated AI cores. In meditek dimensity 1200 ai SoC... In terms of AI computation this mobile can easily beat even a full sized CISC CPU.Overall the performance of phone is excellent.Just a only thing that I'm concerned of is that 2 units of this model has been reported to get exploded. So It is really a Matter of concern for me also. Hope so nothing bad happens.. and if any manufacturing defects in this model. So OnePlus should thoroughly analyze and if problem is serious they should get all sold unit back with full refund."
"It's another android mobile...don't compare it with op series.Poor interfaceTerrible cameraHangAuto re-startHeating issueNetwork connectivity issueUr all data is being shared with Chinese app for which u give a confirmation at the first time of using the phone...all ur photos , location etc.Suggest it to someone u have a grudge on.."
I've been using OnePlus phone since past 7 years and the experience was really good and OnePlus nord 2 is a great phone to use its fast and user friendly. If you're a gamer like to play games alot or whether you're a working professionals the phone on is for you. The battery life is simply amazing it last for almost a day with extreme use and 2 days with a minimal use of a phone. The 65w charger fully charge in 30min. So it's a phone that you can relay on.
"If you prefer minimalistic design with a clean OS, no bloatware then this is absolutely the phone you should go for. The rear camera is phenomenal especially night mode the selfie cam isn't great but good enough. The warp charge 65 is ridiculously fast I got 0-100 in 33 minutes flat. The screen is butter smooth with 90hz refresh rate and the overall feel of the phone in hand is simply excellent. If you are a hard-core gamer maybe this isn't the best phone for you as there are other options but for someone like me who isn't particularly into gaming this is the best I could have asked for in this price range. Definitely worth buying😄"
After a lot amount of research I thought to buy the Nord 2 and I am fully satisfied with it. Best phone under 30k. In this segment we see only gaming phones but this one is a all rounder.Camera - 9/10 front camera is good not excellent rear camera is mind blowing( also night mode)🤯Battery - 9/10 The battery gives nearly 7 hrs of SOT which is more enough for any normal user heavy users will get to charge 2 times a dayCharging- 10/10 very quick chargingSound quality and cellular reception10/10 excellent sound quality and good fingerprint reader and microphone no issuesI didn't experience any heating issue it gets warm while charging but that's usual so no worriesIf u are person who game for 2 to 3hrs a day and take photos regularly and requires a good software experience go for it no second thoughts.
"After a month use, I could notice..1. Many technical/software bugs, even not able to perform full functionality in the basic inbuilt applications.2. Unable to edit numbers on calculator, it's basis requirement.3. Unable to do conference calling, when I try to conference it just gets discounts automatically.4. Heating issues now and then (I just use basic additional applications)5. I have logged a ticket with one plus Nord support team. They mentioned, it will get resolved in next OS updates but I'm affraid after hearing the blast case.6. Support team mentioned they will take remote access and try to resolve the heating issues. I'm just hoping it will get sorted out.7. My return policy is expired otherwise I would have returned this product."
Seems like a true upgrade to one plus nord and the feel is different altogether. It will give you a premium feel.Pros:-1) Camera:- Straight outta one plus 9 pro2) Display:- Super Amoled3) Body and Design:- Top notchCons:-1) No 3mm Jack2) Netflix and prime not supported in HDR. Also you can't stretch upto full screen3) Lower refresh rate
"I did not expect from One+ in the 30K range.I received my handset on 30 July, before that I was very excited about my phone. But after using this handset for two days totally disappointed with the One+ plus orde 2 and feel like cheated.Proc:-1) Only Brand Value or look-wise.2) Charging Speed.Cons.1) Battery drain very fast. Charge two times in a day for normal use like, Viewing videos on youtube, Make videos and clicking images, and playing games.2) Display is not that good, Even 15K phones give a better display.3) Heating issue, even on using camera app or normal use.4) No FM radio.5) No inbuilt music player.6) Google Auto call recorder (inform calling person, then there is no use of call recording)7) Oxygon OS merges with OPPO, Lots of Bugs.Verdict:- Don’t buy One+ Nord 2, please select another phone."
"Battery drains out in 3-4 hours ( specially when hot spot is on)Worse quality camera, can't even focus on flower, makes it totally blur,Selfie adds unnecessary makeup, even to boys, Boys look like girls ... ( 0 rating to camera outof 5)And many other issues as well with cameraDoesn't catch network where normal, cheapest phone catch very easilyThough 5g, it gives the feel of 2g phone.This is the first and last time I am buying 1+ phone...Totally disappointed...Total total total waste of money... Never buy it..."
Pros:-Phone looks premiumFast Charging is awesomeSound quality is goodPhone is pretty fast so farCons:-Not happy with indoor camera picsPictures are not clear after zoomNo headphone jackNo headset in the box
"Battery draining very fast, usually I have to charge it two times in a day even after normal uses. I don't play any games."
Fully feature loaded phone with a good camera and top notch displayOnly point where its a thumbs down is the battery life - although the warp 65 charger takes only 12 minutes to charge it to more than 90% but still the juice doesn't last for more than 15-18 hours
"Phone is awesome 😎..I was eagerly waiting for this phone and very happy now.I have been using this from almost one month and No major issues found in the phone.But while playing games, temperature of phone gets increasing which every phone does that.Camera quality is very well appreciated.Battery back up not that much satiesfied but 65 watts fast charging covers this inconvenience.You just have to keep charger with you all the time.Dimensity 1200 processor gives you smooth experience while playing games and while  using heavy applications.According to me.my decision was right and I'm happy with it."
The phone is good but big disappointment as for 30kNO IN BUILT FM RADIONO HANDSFREE OR EARPHONESI think there was a lot of hype about the phone. Camera and battery life is good.For music lovers  this phone is a big Noooooo
Mono and ultrawide lens are seems useless...Battery back is little less but u will neva feel that due to its massive 65W charger...which will charge ua phone in no time....does anyone facing sensor issue like during calls screen will off when we touch our phone to ear and when we resume the phone to use...its screen doesn't wake up immediately...Or its my screen gaurd issue...
"Battery life is not good if you are normal user than ok but for a heavy user you have to juice it up two times a day. But thanks to fast charger it balances the battery life.Display brightness for outdoor in sunlight struggles  it should be more.In- Display Finger print scanner cannot replace the normal scanner. Except these everything is great no lags, good camera, fast apps opening."
"Mobile is getting overheated when you play games like ""Battlegrounds Mobile India"". The temperature went upto 43 C where you cannot continue playing as the heat becomes very annoying. Attached the screenshot for temperature rise.Even after updating the software, the heat didn't get reduced. If you are a gamer, go for some other model with snapdragon processor or any other configuration. Because of this overheating, battery will get drained out easily."
"इस फ़ोन की बैट्री में दिक्कत लग रही है,सोशल मीडिया पर भी इसकी नॉर्ड -2 वनप्लस 5g में बैट्री फटने से घायल होने की लगातार सूचनाएं प्राप्त हो रही है, कम्पनी को इस फ़ोन को वापस ले लेना चाहिए,जिस से लोगो को घायल होने से बचाया जा सकें,आज दिनांक 10.11.21को अमर-उजाला दैनिक समाचार पत्र प्रथम पेंच पर भी यही ख़बर छपी है, मेरे पास भी यही फ़ोन है आज ही इसको बेच दूंगा या इसको एक्चेंज में देकर किसी अन्य कंपनी का नया फोन खरीद लूंगा।। लगभग-लगभग 35000रू का यह फ़ोन लिया था  ,सब बेकार हो गए।।"
"Camera is comparatively good, smooth experience, but need few usual features like in video, changing the play speed, directly opening the links in the whatsapp on a browser/YouTube when selecting,(have to copy and paste the link in the browser) I hope these little things will be fixed in future updates.Only drawback for me is the Battery Life, it drains much faster compared to my Vivo V20s."
Purchased this phone on 16th May 2022 after near about 40 days whenever I play video & audio starts it automatically got switched off this problem is coming some time earlier but from last 2 days every single time I play video it just got switched off. Was planning for iPhone but switched to One plus because someone recommend. But I think Apple is king in his segment because of quality & his product One Plus is Chinese no matter how much money you invested in Chinese is Chinese always... Pathetic now i don't know what to do next
Not even been a year and this phone gives endless troubles. Photos look weird even after turning off all the effects. Keeps hanging and needs to be restarted. I was a big fan of OnePlus but after this phone I will never buy one.
"As a OnePlus Fan, Nord2 didn't disappoint me at all. Felt so comfortable while taking pictures, attending calls, watching movies etc.. Battery I would rate par, as i have to recharge every single day, where Oneplus 5t which was my earlier phone stayed for two days approximately.  But good thing is with the fast charging capability my phone gets charged for 80% in 20 minutes.,I definitely feel proud and would recommend it for others too."
I am writing this review after one month of moderate usage . If you are a working professional then this phone fulfill your all basic requirements in flowless manner .Pros:1. Camera quality is amazing in both daylight and night2. Battery backup is good3. Screen size is adequate and resolution is good too.4. Processor work flowless . Multitasking and switching between apps is effective.5. Fast charging takes only 15-20 min to full your battery to 100 from 0 percent6. Integration with wearable device was also fine
Camera doesn't Start when it's get heatSome softwere issueDon't buy if u are a gamerScreen is small for gameingAnd don't by otg cabe buy a jack for headphoneHactic feedback is too goodAnd I wanted to return which was impossible and I want to return now too and buy poco gt
"In short it works as how it does, But not how it supposed to be as described by the manufacturer.Amazon truely cheats customers, safeguarding their return policy.I was told that "" Amazon cannot provide a return even if the user felt the quality and satisfaction was not up to the mark.""Insted said ""will be getting what's written inside the product specification "" 🤗🤗Do they think, customers are such dumb ordering without specs. Wonder how they didn't realise the fact that the real experience comes when it was used and/or felt in the hand.Again @jeff... This is for you 💗"
I was a fan of oneplus have been using it since couple of years this time oneplus nord 2 no doubt is a good mobile phone but battery gets drained faster as it's capacity is less screen is not at all bright enough auto brightness makes it dull not clearly visible speakers are excellent allover its just an average phone oneplus has lost its touch that was there
"So far nothing to dislikePros:1. Camera excellent2. Battery overall ok 7 hour Avg heavy gamer3. Charging 30 min4. Display excellent5. Touch responsive, good haptic feedback6. Sound loud and clearCons:1. Fingerprint Avg 3 out 5 time works2. Heating not much3. Low light camera struggle4. Low tint effect from side view"
I needed a combo of flawless gaming performance and feature-full camera that gives me quality pictures. OnePlus Nord2 just satisfies me with my requirements. I didn't feel any drawback of headphone jack unavailability. Phone has a great bluetooth connectivity and no issues when in calls or even gaming. There are alot of in-built features in the phone. I am still exploring. There's a exclusive feature called as pro-gaming which is great for gamers.
Phone is heating randomly. Feeling very unsafe to use the phone with the ph blasting newsIt's always on the mind that something wrong will happen. when i use the phone my hand feels some wrong vibes. Don't want to use the phone anymore.I want to return the phone.
Both Cameras(Front and Back) are good especially Back... In-Display finger print sensor is good but slow... 4500mAh battery takes only 30mins to reach 100% from 0%... The sound quality and loudness is incomparable with other mobile phones... Display quality is Amazing...
"The phone is fine but at times the screen freezes. I had to take the phone to the service centre three(3) times to get the fault rectified. It was even before I could start using the phone. I hope that it will work without any fault not, not sure though. One plus has certainly downgraded the quality. Pity!"
"Everything is great except Battery Life. Even on a two week old phone getting through the day is impossible. Without any gaming, making videos or social media scrolling, battery drops to 40% before 4PM. Just normal Whatsapp, news and little bit of other apps can cause drastic battery reduction. Although wrap charger is extremely fast, but can't keep searching sockets everywhere to charge."
I liked this phone overall however I returned this product since I was facing major restart issue every now and then even with using only social media apps.I am not an ardent phone user however was disappointed that this phone couldnt even match it and kept restarting again and again.Thank you Amazon for refunding the entire amount with no grievance.
"It has heating issue,I never believed but when I started using for 6 months i can definitely say that it has heating issue, you can not use this phone for video recording and even for shooting Instagram reels, phone getting heated in 10 mins of continuous usage.I don't play any games, only normal usages but still it's getting heat.They have reduced the refresh rate and now it start getting stuck/freezed inbetween.Worst buy ever."
"After transferring 50gb data from my old iphone, my new one plus started slowing down(didn't hang, but slowed)Battery only 6-8hours.Fingerprint reader takes 2secs to recogniseCamera is not so great. May be you can check in showroom at dim lights.Overall 3/5."
"If you want a balanced device go for it . Performance is greatDevice Size is compact &handyFluid amoled is awesomeSound is stereo speakers very loudCamera 📸 is very goodI'm not a Gamer so ..... According to my uses its a one day battery 🔋 life for browsing, educational purposes, watchingYouTube, listening audio, social media .Charging is awesome just 30 minutes 0 to 100Haptic touch is awesome 👍For me no heating issue till now.And because of 1+ your friends will notice and jealous ☺️☺️☺️ after all it's a  apple Android."
Its been 5 months since I'm using this device.Camera is impressive with added features.I don't play games so Dimensity 1200 is pretty good for my activities.Battery is good.If you are a medium user it lasts for a day.If you are a heavy user it gives nice backup.Full charge time is 30 minutes.Display is nice because of amoled panel.If you switch from 120hz to 90hz you will feel the difference.If you switch from a old device to this you will feel this smoother.Haptics are impressive.The  problems i am facing now is the white light (flash) turns on automatically when I switch to front camera.
"1. 2 Jio Sims not working at the same time.2. Server unreachable error most of the times even when emergency calls are to be made3. Call recording announcement, which defeats the purpose of recording.4. No other recording app works on the phone5. Google Dialer very bad, no other dialer works.6. Google Messages App another disaster.Overall - 1 / 10...Huge Waste of Money."
"Awesome cameraAwesome Night photosPremium phoneGood lookingFast and no any heating issueAmazing displayNo bloatware and simple,fast and elegant UI"
"Major issues:Phone heats up even during normal usage. Ex- 5 mins of what's app call phone temperature increased and you can feal the heat even on back cover.Battery backup is not good. Maximus you will get 6 hrs of backup with normal use.Oxygen has lot bugs, may be because of the merger of code base, those needs to be fixed.Overall not satisfied with the product."
"Back camera superbFront camera goodSpeakers niceBattery amazingCharger superdustI give 4 star bcoz suffering issue in apps auto exit, sd storage error msg.Overall phone is completly outstanding."
"I am writing this review only after 1 day of usage. So, here's my experience with the phone as it is my 1st phone from 1+.First of all when i tried to start the phone for the very 1st time, it was kindaa stuck in the bootloader for more than 10 minutes and restarted about 3-4 times. I thought that 1+ might have provided me with a glitched phone but afterall it started somehow.Screen on time i was getting is about 6 hrs with 20% battery remaining. I was using phone in 90 fps and internet was on all the time.Phone heats upto 45° while playing BGMI and wide angle camera sucks. Front camera is not upto the mark."
"Beautiful design, camera quality is superb, sound is awesome, battery life is bit of a negative side but thanks to the super fast charging. It takes 30 minutes for full charge. AI feature of the camera is outstanding. Processor is great. Altogether a flagship killer in its proce tag. I got this phone for Rs. 23000 only, I got a discount of Rs. 2000 and exchange my old phone for Rs. 5000, altogether a great deal for me. I am fully satisfied."
"Pros:1.) Display is good and refresh rate is Ok2.) Wrap charging gives me a fantastic full charge within minutes.3.) Dual Speaker gives good Audio performanceCons:1.) HEATING ISSUE  -Sometimes while charging it heats tremendously without reason.At that time I think about Oppo parent comapny resemblence to this.2.)Camera is not upto the mark,poor clarity when I zoom it either while shooting and the images as well.3.) UI -Color OS not have any unique speciality when attached to Oxygen.Thinking about is it worth for money after 1month rigorous use."
"I am using it for the last 15 days only, the phone gets hanged and the screen becomes dark (nothing works) and the phone has a heating issue as well. Feel some camera Issues also as the picture comes blurred. Little disappointing, considering OnePlus, a Brand. I preferred it over iPhone but got disappointment. I can't return it as the return window is closed."
"After using it for a week, I likes it's camera which is really nice. Front camera require some improvement but still works fine. It has an amazing charging speed, 66 watt charger is the real killer. Amazing backup. Just loved it🥰. Worth every single penny. An all-rounder in this price segment.🤗"
"Face detection not working, music App not there, compusary buy a new earbuds, battery fastly drain. My humble request plan anyone plz don't prefer this mobile."
"1. After using the iPhone for the last 6 years, I found The security system in this phone(ONEPLUS NORD 2 5G) is not good enough. Anyone can break the security in less than 2 min. The phone asking permission to manage phone calls, photo gallery, location. every time even you open the camera the first time. Still, I don't understand what is the connection between phone calls and camera? I open the camera the first time it asks me to give access to manage phone calls. In privacy and policy, some data can be sent to CHINA, WHY?2. I have no complaint about processor. it works well.3. 32MP front camera, waste of money. need to improve a lot.Overall I do not recommend this phone."
The best Nord series phone from OnePlus.Pros:65W charging speed6.43 inch fluid amoled screenGood back cameraMediatek 1200 processor6 SA 5G bandsSmooth snappy performanceCons:No 3.5 mm headphone jackColorOS is creeping into OxygenOS120 hz refresh rate missingBattery is average
"Software 9/10Buttery smooth software. Minor bugs here and there like sometimes after the call the screen remains blank and it becomes difficult to end the call.Oneplus should fix this upDesign 9/10Simple sleek design. Matt finish always pleasing to the eye and attracts least smudges.Battery life 9/10The fast charging feature is the one you cant go back from.5 mins of emergency charge could save your day.Camera 9/10Low light camera feature is absolutely on point. Beating even it's big brother 9 proValue for money 9/10Perfect price range.Wasn't hoping this device in this price range, after the loot oneplus had had with 9 series."

 This is 12/250 model : see how it's working. Not able search application in application menu. As well many time it hang in some applications so we have to close the app or need to restart phone . Suggest you go for different. ""Also tried uninstall and reinstall the Android system web view."""
zaruri nahi sab ka phon kharab nikle.. mera toh shi hai.. baki game wagera khailne wale he roo rahe normal use k lye shi.Battery chal jati hai thik thak par charge bhy jaldi ho jata hai..Jo camera k lye bol rahe un se anurodh hai phon ki jagh camera he lo..
"Very bad front camera , which stutters and it feels like a 2mp camera that we used to have in old phones.I tried to find reviews before buying but  it looks like oneplus and amazon play well by probably providing better units to reviewers.And also allowing reviews to be added very late so that buyers are left with not much info.Nevertheless, coming to performance of the phone although it boast of dimensity 1200 but still scores less that phones with same processor.The oneplus always lacked camera prowess but I believe that was compensated with better and clean os, but this time that too was taken away as across phone we color os lookwhich makes phone same as realme or oppo.All in all while the phones looks good in the online reviews but in realtime usage it disappoints."
"Been waiting for a long time to get the right one from oneplus. This is it. Recent oneplus' phones do not convinced me at all. But, this! It sure does.Pros:1. Charger is superb2. Battery last almost 30 hrs (normal day-to-day use)3. 90Hz refresh rate with Amoled is more than enough for me.4. Mobile internet connectivity is better than other brands5. So is the wifi6. Received an update right after booting up the phone7. Main camera is awesome. I do not need the ultrawide lens at all as the main camera is wide enough for my needs.Cons:1. Phone is a bit heavy2. Ultrawide camera is not as great as the main camera3. For shooting macro objects it's best to be on pro mode.For the skeptics- just go for it, you won't regret it."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's awesome, this phone is mind-blowing product at this segment.It's look very premium.In hand feel is awesome.You should definitely goes for it if your budget is 30k.Camera quality is also good, but not at high level.The important thing for this phone is oxygen os and one plus branding.65w charger is a monster 💀-it takes 33min to complete charge.This is definitely called a flagship phone.There is one thing that I thought it should better is- instead of dimensity they should give Snapdragon.If you buy it, then you never regret at your decision."
"Just so the customer is clear on the color gray, it has a tint of blue so you can call it a lighter shade of pigeon gray not the charcoal or any darker side. The pictures are not showing the correct colors for me.Otherwise, no need to add words to phone review. Runs great, feels good in hand.Although I did not like the fact there are so many apps (google and oneplus) which require permissions the first time we setup device or use them first. Cant say if there would be privacy issues."
"I became fan of Oneplus Nord 2 after month usage.PROS:-Camera,Fast Charging,User friendly UI,Smooth working,CONS:-Battery discharge is high when using continously.Overall performance is very good."
"I m using this phone from last two month, I have tried almost all setting of camera but it's camera it not at all good. Xiaomi's 15000 phone has batter camera quality then this, only brand value u will get with this nothing else, same specification we can get in half price, in my opinion we should go with other brands. Like xiaomi, oppo, vivo and others"
Pros :1.Slim and good in hand feelBack camera is Good.2.Oxygen os and color os combination is nice some of cool features we can use in camera app.3.super fast charging.Cons :Worsssssssssstttttt front camera 0.5 out of 10Such a worst front camera
Pros:1. Best in class camera(better than one plus8-s)2. Flagship processor3. Fingerprint is damn fast4. Feels premium5. Charges in less than half an hour. 65watts6. Battery gives 6:30 to 7 hours of screentime with 90Hz which is pretty sickCons:No cons as of now. Some UI improvements are needed in the camera app
It's worst mobile in segment price 30k because battery life too poor and camera quality too worst. Please go to MI OR SAMSUNG IF YOU HAVE TO BUY MOBILE SEGMENT 30k.  in price segy 30k OnePlus Nord worst mobile if OnePlus not to fixed bug of camera and battery I also bin that mobile and purchase another mobile like my opinion buy Mi or samsung
"Now it had been 23 days past since I had purchased this phone. It's working totally fine, no heating issues, the battery life will work till 1 and a half day if use it frequently. If your budget is 30k then it it's a best purchase. Camera quality is also good. And the refresh rate is also good till now."
"Camera not working properly, and Amazon is not providing replacement after two technician visit, problem not resolved report submitted by technician but customer care says report is resolved, and customer suffers. I prefer not to buy from Amazon. Go to market buy a phone. Customer have to take risk on his/her job and talk to thier executives whole day and still suffers."
Pros:1) can charge very fast and can last one whole day2) Can handle the high end games and applications very easily3) Rear camera is good4) Screen quality is OK5) Build quality is very good and I like leather finishCons:1) Front camera is worst.2) 90 hz screen can be better3) mobile is getting stuck while playing video in youtube and also some times audio fluctuates while listening to music and browsing in youtube.4) OS is little buggy5) HDR is not available in prime and Netflix6)
"Product is good so far, no hassle but the way it was delivered was crazy. The exchange now demands that you don't do a factory reset on the phone till they verify via Amazon app running on the phone to be exchanged. If you have an older version of phone , the amazon app does not work on it. So you have to update everything and keep the phone as it was till the delivery person comes to your house. Chances of Data Leakage- Very High. A lot of Wastage of time also, as you have to do a factory reset and other data deletion after it is accepted for exchange. You 1 or 2 hours may be wasted and if the app doesnt work, God only can help you."
"I recently bought this product, found camera quantity to be great, warp charge help battery charging in quick time, observed few issues, YouTube gets hung frequently, caller id display issueI am really disappointed with this product, even after paying 30 K the output is not up to the mark"
"Touch & look is awesome but I am very disappointing because inbuilt App Cloning is not working, no inbuilt fitness app..I think we can choose better option in same price range.Product is not worthy as compare to cost..Overall product is not as per my expectations.."
"Fingerprint reader is a bit slow. Like takes approx a twentieth second more than other. No issues with face unlock though.Phone needs to be charged twice daily. For rough usage.Gaming is good. Battery backup is efficient while gaming and no major heat issues. I played for approx 3 -4 hours.No headphone jack, but the alert slider is included.Charging takes approx 30-35 minutes for full charge.Other phones provide 120fps In this price range.(realme x7 max, Poco f3 gt)Camera is great. The night mode is also good.The mixture of color OS and Oxygen OS in this phone doesn't feel like a premium oneplus phone like the 9 series. Its like Oppo phones, but I've got no issues with it.So overall a great deal. I liked this one."
"Got it by exchanging my 4-year-old moto, So for 26K. The Camera works great and the pictures are absolutely breathtaking. Performance is quite smooth. It gave me a full charge in about 15 mins. I have been using it for two days on one charge, So the battery is pretty great too. Happy with my purchase. Thank you One Plus and the seller for this product. Amazon rarely disappoints."
Summarise:-Camera - 5/5Screen Quality - 5/5Fast Charging - 5/5Battery life - 2/5Everything looks good in this budget flagship killer except batteryNeed to charge twice if you constantly using internet on your device
"Not found better than realme 7 that was exchanged, except for the  loudness not great quality. Screen not smooth-- for finger surfing. Takes time to load apps. Charging also not exactly as claimed. Even screen touch misses, once in a while. Stopped playing youtube video even when autoplay is on. Auto answered call without ring or vibrate. Hangs. Overlapping text when font/display size increased. Great looks though."
"Fingerprint sensor: annoying..Just like other in display scanners.7/10UI: Best in the business.10/10Camera: 9/10. Produces real colors, with fast clickBattery: lasts whole day.8/10Charging: 11/10....Charges full in 30 mins.....65w charger worth the hype.Feeling in hand: 10/10..Looks premium...Quite a handy for daily usageDisplay: 8/10...Good at this range.... Although mi11x have better display..."
"Really amazing phone. Initially I was confused to pick a phone since poco GT is also a great choice in this price range, but finally I decided to go on with the one plus experience. From the  first week experience I would say the phone is really smooth with the oxygen os and fast charging is super amazing. Phone battery is good, I still have some 20-30 percentage left end of day. So really happy in this area. I was a bit disappointed with the blue colour should have opted for grey instead. But that is a personal opinion. Overall really happy with the purchase."
After using two weeks Iam giving this review.1st of all Iam using One Plus mobile for the 1st time. Shifting IOS Operating sytem.This phone is superb after using two weeks. The pros and cons are.PROSTouch is fine n perfect.Camera is fine both front n backNeworks and internet connectivity good.Perfect finish lookwise.CONS of this phone is the heating problem.. which is most irritating.If company can fix this issue in coming software updates if possible. It will be best phone for this proce .If u want to buy this phone u can have it . Its value for money..For Heating issue iam giving 4 stars.. if not i could have given 5 on 5.
Liked the phone. Migrated from Samsung and must say is better than Samsung. Good connectivity no matter what m doing. Clear voice on calls. The speakers are loud. In display FP scanner works fairly could be better.Battery back up is lesser. Should have atleast a 5000 mah battery as continuous usage does drain fast. 65 watt chargers helps but can't carry that brick everywhere
"After using a day my honest reviewDisplay 10/10Performance 9/10Camera selfie 6/10Camera rear 7/10Haptic response 10/10Battery 8/10Looks 9/10Note - If you planning for buy this then go for grey Sierra colour and camera is not upto mark remember my word.,Thank you"
"First of all, this is my first 1+ phone and I am regreting for the same.Pros:1. Colour and design considering the price segment2. Super dart chargingCons:1. Battery drains very fast2. Very poor face unlock3. Poor UI4. App clone work with only WhatsApp, FB, insta . It won't work with other apps (stocks and other apps)5. U can't see downloaded images and vdo's in Gallery from whatsapp6. When u get call, for few seconds the name of person won't appear on the screen and u can see the name only after sometime7. High SAR value compared to competitors8. Camera quality is not adequateThese are my preliminary observations. It is irritating sometimes to use."
When I heard about this new launched phone I was so much excited.but when I got thi and start use this phone than I know that this is my biggest mistake to purchase this phone.its getting heated up in morning to evening even after 5-6 calls and battry is getting down to down in evry minute.even I have to charge this phone twice a day.please replace this phone or give me my money back..
"Using this mobile for 1 month.(12GB and 256 GB variant) Battery backup is good even with heavy apps and games like PUBG battleground. Came across slight heating issue while charging. The AmoLED display is awesome. Bluetooth and Connectivity is also on good side. The AI camera is not up to the mark (adds unnecessary blur), also there is some noise in normal photo mode as compared to portrait mode.The processor is very fast and efficient , no glitches or lags observed.Stereo speakers perform very good ,but I feel headphone jack should have been provided.Overall nice mobile and lives to the expectations of OnePlus Brand name"
"Oneplus by far has the best phones in Android. The speed, the user interface, the entire look and feel of the phone is amazing! Never heats or hangs! It’s a phone that one will repeat. I used the Oneplus 6 for 3 years and now moved to the Nord2. It the most amazing phone in that budget"
"After a lot of waiting, evaluating, finally got the phone with perfect specs & price .. not over priced like flagship, but performance equal or better! Awesome camera pics, good design & build. Got in net 19k after exchange, credit card discount. So definitely worth it!"
"Has been a day since use. Everything works very well and at a blazing fast speed.Battery:Charged from 1 to 100 percent and really took only 30 minutes. Great promise delivered.Gaming:I am a BGMI gamer. A lag free phone with no heating at 50% brightness. Took 30% battery for 1:45 hours of play.Camera:Seems Great to me compared to several other phones at this price range.Sound:The sounds in earphone are kind of 3D, which feels fabulous to me.No problems so far.Note: Will update in a week."
Don't buy one plus mobiles it's useless brand ;one plus is jhaatoo brand ;camera quality ghatiya hai ;heating issue 😐 mobile temperature will be always 45 degree Celsius overheating ;don't check fake reviews
"After using one month the feedback isPros -Phone Aesthetic is good,Rear Camera is Very goodCons -Front camera performance is patheticDuring video call, front camera image gets stillWhile surfing Photo gallery or website, phone gets hang or badly slows down.Heat up while charging as well with little heavy use.Couldn't feel the effect of 8 GB RAM"
Got it today.Phone looks premium.Seamless transfer of apps and contacts from my old phone were very smooth.No lag so far.Yet to test the camera.Got 1k extra on exchange.(5.4k in total for Moto Power One).Pleased with the transaction.
"Uhhhh...Color OS has ruined the premiuness and auto call record feature has been theown away from all BBK electronic mobiles. Will never go for oneplus series..... No security just like Knox or thinkshield. Waste of money. Wireless charger may be given, display size is average and not having 120hz. But considering the price range it's ok."
"Super pathetic battery life without even using it discharge withing 14 15 hours and if I use it continuously use it then goes down in 8 9 hours max, camera is below average, UI is not upto the mark same with performance thing some times hang up and heat up most of the times, could have been more better in this price range.Need to optimise it so that battery life goes up with more performance."
"I am not satisfied with this product. I was using iPhone and thought to try One Plus this time. I can feel the difference between an iPhone and Andriod but must say that no one can beat the iPhone experience. The one plus battery is poor and I need to charge twice a day. This is not good for travellers or gamers.The front camera is 32 megapixels but it is like a normal phone. The rear camera is awesome and clicks good pictures. The 100% phone charges in 30-45 minutes only which is a +ive. However, there is news of phone blats that make me scary. I will not suggest spending 30 K on this phone. You will get the same experience on 15-20 k phones only so there is no need to spend this amount"
"Posting the review after reqrous use of handset that are below as :-Front and back camera is stunning..- battery backup is commendable-Display/ fingerprint/ screen smoothness is awasome..In last I tried to search negative things about phone, but could not found even single one..- can purchase without any single doubt..Thanks one plus for releasing such phones.."
"Honost review please read it -When I got this mobile I given 5 star but thenafter I need to edit is as 1 star because after 1 month use it started lagging I can't watch videos can't play pubg now iam typing this very slowly. After clearing ram it is ok for 5 minutes.  Then it will start laging again I don't know what to do I wasted hard worked  30 k of money 😑😑😑 OnePlus please consider me and arrange exchange/return/ refund anything. (1200 dimencity processor,8gb ram  what is its use?? Full of lag while watching YouTube also....my 4 gb ram  asus  old mobile working 100times better than this..please give me a solution ..."
This is my first one plus phone. I am really excited when I bought. But my excitement really hadn't last longer. The phone is heating lot. Batter is draining. When I making calls the calls are dropping. I didn't expect one plus to sell phones like these. Even without testing quality of their phones. Things I liked is oxygen os which is smooth and speakers. Display and camera is average. I don't recommend this device. Please go and purchase samsung or motorola instead of buying these Chinese products. Amazon please test the quality of the product before you sell in your website
"Camera Quality is not Good,Screen Auto Rotation Failure, Disappointed in many TimesBattery Backup is very Short timeFully usage in 4 HoursOrdinary Usage in 8 Hours"
I received my phone today. Previously I was using one plus 6 for last 2years. Now I though of moving to Nord series.The phone is very appealing in looks. Camera looks decent however it is far from 9R. Charging is superfast undoubtedly. I will recommend this phone to those who are not too much in gaming.Back in 2018-19 OnePlus use to give multiple cases which they have stopped now.Only thing I find missing in this phone is headphone jack.  After paying Rs30000 I have to pay more to get a Bluetooth earphone.
It's been two weeks I am using OnePlus nord 2.Sony IMX 766 it is used as the primary sensor and I really like the ultra wide sensor. I really like the design of the phone and build quality. The display nits is descent for outdoor use it has a 90hertz display instead of 120hertz. It has a poor batter Life but OnePlus has solved this issue the 65w fast charger which comes in the box. It's using colour OS butit has a lot of bug fix also it has the same UI used in oxygen OS overall it's the best smartphone under 30000
I am using this mobile in field as I work in Air conditioning service. Battery Backup is not as expected and heats a lot. Please guys do not purchase this phone mainly Mediatek Dimensity 1200 processor heats a lot. Please go for Snapdragon only
"Here's my review after a month of usage. Firstly I liked it's glass back it looks & give a premium feel nd very attractive. Coming to the performance it's very smooth in day to day normal usage, I didn't notice any lags, stutter or app crashes. Im not a gamer so not tested in that zone. Otherwise it takes very good still daylight and night pics. 8 mp nd 2 mp is crap of no use, have not tested on video part. Battery backup is decent nd fast charging is just awesome. Overall its not for gamers, for normal day to day users its just fit. If u want clean UI and smooth performance go for it."
"Design 8/10 (solid build, plastic farme)In hand feel 9/10Camera 7/10 (selfie camera needs improvement)Battery 09/10 (8 hrs of screen on time for normal users)Charging 10/10Sound.  07/10 (quite loud, quality is just average)Performance 9/10 (fast for a normal user)Software 8/10 (noticed some bugs)Display 8/10 ( Good enough for normal user)Network reception 10/10 ( 7 5g bands wifi 6, 4g+, good call quality)Haptics 09/10Happy with the product."
The cellphone remains in landscape mode of we attend any calls while it was in landscape.You have to manually sw off the auto rotation.
"This is very good phone from One plus.Pros-Good build qualityGood designFast chargingGood CameraGood Software experienceCons-No headphone jackBad monochrome 2 MP sensorCamera could be much better, it needs software updates"
"Nord 2 is best camera phone with Sony camera in this price.Battery backup is ok, last up to 1 day with heavy uses and 2 days with power saving modeLook and grip is as good as all the flagship series"
Koi bhi bhai mt lena es phone ko battery backup bilkul bekar h full charge krne ke baad batter apne aap kam hoti rehti h bina use kiye .. or aapko koi help nhi milegi Amazon ki traf se agr aapko ye psnd nhi h to Amazon bs keh deti h ki oneplus ke customer care me jao..  camera quality bhi normal h jitna btaya gya tha us hisab se best nhi h..
Bought the One Plus Nord 2 on the first day only...Although its been just a day use but things I noticed are...1) Dimensity 1200 processor is very fast and hence the performance of the phone is super smooth.2) 90 Hz display is fabulous.3) Charging is fast but the phone heats up a bit during charging.4) Camera is good for normal use5) Very loud speakers6) Gaming should not be any problem even at the highest settings.Conclusion :Considering the Price I paid with the discount and exchange around 25K...its a very powerful phone at this price point....Hope this review is helpful...Thank you..!!!
"OnePlus, we all used to love OnePlus phone in terms of pricing and specifications but i think now time has been change for OnePlus, i had good expectations with nord 2 but if I'll talk about battery, so phone get heat up very easily and it scared me sometime.And daylight camera is good but ultra wide camera is useless and Front camera is worst to worst. I think OnePlus forget that they are charging 30,000 not 15000.1.Front camera worst.2. Ultra wide camera useless3. Most scary phone heat up alotThank you"
"Dera all mobile buyers , don't buy this mobile phone, it's true review, I'm feeling very bad selection this mobile, after one month this mobile will Start problem hanging, not working properly, customer service also very bad, pls don't buy this product"
One of the worst phone I had ever used and service is very pathetic . After buying 9 days my loudspeaker got complaint . So I went to the nearest authorised service centre and they told me to keep the phone in the service centre. And I kept my brand new mobile in service centre. Now it’s almost 20 days phone is still in the service centre . And their reason is spare part is not available . My only mistake is buying one plus mobile phone . Service is very very bad
"Amazing One Plus Nord 2. Got at an amazing price with Exchange offer. Loving it.Positives:Battery life, Amazing sleek design, Finger Print reading, Fast charging, Easy to handle, Light weight and greater speed.In box got a back cover for mobile which is nice too.Negatives:No Headset Jack.LED notification blinks for messages, calls is not available.Suggestion:Headset can be included for this price range."
"As seeing the news of explosion 3rd time, I think it's the wrong choice I made it this time to bought this mobile. As it is my first one plus mobile and getting this type of news make me feel like why I bought thus. Is there any to return this mobile and get back my money."
"Nice e, very premium look phone.go for it.i am using from 20 days. BatteryBack is also good.more than one day will easily go with normal usage"
..feeling unsafe....want refund... don't buy this phone... please do not risk ur life
"Awesome phone, superfast"
There were several incidents of one plus nord 2 blasts.please don't buy it.
Baught this mobile for 1st time with high amount(for me).Facing worst experience with signals - even in regular places every time calls are strucking like there is signal issue.Camera - not more clarity as I expected.Phone - while speaking to call it's automatically touching cheeks and pressing unmute button.Charging - is good. Fast charging and more charging.Finally I'm feeling like I wasted my 30000Rs. Unnecessarily.
✅ Camera - best indoor and lowlights photography🆗 Outdoor photography✅ Display - best✅ Build quality✅ Best sound quality✅ Fast charging - takes 30mins max🆗 Battery✅ Processor✅ Fingerprint reader - works best❌ Wired headphones support - you will need a type C to 3.5mm jack convertor
"After 2 months of use, I can say it is value for money. Points I want to mention-Pros- 1. Good camera- performs extremely well in low light conditions. 2.Powerfull processor- I felt no lag in bgmi and day to day gaming. 3.Heating Issue- No heating issue. 4.Oxygen os- this os is not pure oxygen os still very impressive.5. Superfast charging- 66 watt charger charges 100% in just 30 mins.Cons-  1.BATTERY LIFE- Although the charging is fast but Battery life can be better.  2.No HDR streaming supportOverall worthy purchase."
"No matter how fast Mediatek processor is on paper, not worth in real life. Phone is lagging while playing basic games like F1.Camera is okayNormal day to day is okay.Display okay.Processor bad.Charging excellent"
Everything is ok just doesn't feel like my OnePlus.... It's like an oppo phone with OnePlus sticker... Can't do call recording for all calls... Even if u manually turn it on it sends out a warning to the person on the phone that the call is being recorded.
Every thing is good1 mobile recived in which camera is not working.2  mobile in which battery is getting drain fastly .Is Amazon selling a refurbished mobile on cost of new one or what want replacement soon . If okay piece is not available then refund the money so I can purchase a MI or samsung in which I hardly get issue after long use
Pros :1. Comfortable 1 day battery even with maximum phone usage.2. Good display (90hz) and nice color reproduction.3. Good haptics and quality switches.4. Great stereo speaker5. Reliable software experience (lacks original OnePlus camera app instead it is using Oppo color os camera app)6. Main camera sensor shoot great photos.7. Video quality is good. (OIS)8. Ultra fast charging experience.Cons:1. Ultrawide camera is not that great compared to main camera2. Front facing camera also an average one.
"I  was a big fan of oneplus, but I and wanted to order a nord 2  after seeing a review, but when I received it the product  I was pretty disappointed because  the phone started  to heat up while using just a watsaap, and the the battery life is pathetic  battery drains so quickly  even when the phone is not in use, I don't know maybe I received the defective product but seriously it really disappointed me,  when I comparethis phone with redmi note 4 I feel that is better than this...."
"A good phone to buy.Pros:-1. Main camera is great.2. Performance is good.3. UI is great.4. Battery is good and charger is great.5. Ram management is great.6. Design is great.7. Display is great.Cons:-1. 90Hz diplay and not 120Hz2. Fingerprint scanner working is a bit slow, little bit slow as i thought (may be okay to you).3. Front camera is 32mp but not working like 32, it's working like 16mp (it may improve after update but i m not sure).Overall a balanced phone without any ads or bloatware.I want to give 4.5 out of 5"
"Not satisfied with this mobile. Camera quality is not as per expectation. Camera quality needs to be improved as compared to this price range. Camera screen size, outlook and brightness also not that much attractive."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very good phone, osm experience but OnePlus should not change the oxygen OS and there's a bit frame drop while gaming, not in every game i experienced in call of duty mobile, and the design feels premium"
Nord2 Looks like a pro smartphone and very very smooth and responsive touch with super fast wrap 65 charger everything works like heaven.But small lag in face recognition sometimes is not recognised my face hope Oneplus will solve this issue in the next update
No discription required for Oneplus. 10/10 for NORD 2.PRIMIUM BUILD QUALITYPRIMIUM LOOKOPTIMUM PERFORMANCEBEST IN CLASSMAINTAINING A1 STANDARDTruly satisfied once again with Oneplus. Over all rating 5*.
I received this product and i noticed its battery draining so fast. Two day after i saw there was thin line on the screen that was clearly showing screen damage or malfunction. I got to connected with customer care and they check the phone and it was declared as defective peice and return it.
"Best mobile @30K with great battery life and performance. The best part about this model is the Slider button to move from Sound/Vibrate/Silent. 65W charger, it charges the mobile 0-80% in less than 30 minutes. Camera is average at this price. I recommend it."
"This is the Best Phone in the Segment,, a lot of features: High quality Sound ,REAR Camera and Selfie Camera are Excellent, AMOLED Display is very Awesome with high colours, Battery lasts for 2 days without Games, Fastest Charger with 65W, Fast Face Unlock and Fingerprint Sensor..Worth Every Penny and 5 Star ⭐ Rating"
"Initially battery life was pathetic but after couple of updates .it's ok now. Fast Charging time is exciting. Overall good experience but if you ask me does it worth for 30k , definitely no. Nothing interesting or special for 30k"
"Apparently the cons are the battery life ,ram management ,operating system and the features available in the pixels, i wish the pixels are available in india or the samsungs with affordable price and snapdragons .Ya for the midrange phone it is the best out there"
The phone is very nice.. battery life is little low. 1 single charge wil go till 1 day if ur not doing any gaming or video call . Camera is pretty good I liked it actually. Charging is very fast. 30mins n ur phone wil b fully charged. Very fast processor
Received damaged piece
Well and good smartphone in this price range and All functions are very good camera quality is amazing only battery is quite good . I have notic that battery is draining little bit fast if you are streaming and scrollling something more that 3 or 4 hrs continues then you will realise and the most important thing is Charging is very fast just put your phone in charge the let for 15 to 20 mit again you can use hole day as normal .90 hrts refresh rate is good but i was expecting at least 120 hrts and 5000 mh battery in this price range .
I was sceptical about buying OP Nord2 after the news and all the dilemma covering the brand but went ahed and bought it. It's been only a week but I'm impressed. I've been a OnePlus user since OnePlus X came out and never changed the brand to any other smartphone. The only con I have rn is the oxygen os has start becoming more and more colorOS and that isn't a great step for OnePlus.
Call recorder not inbuilt.One plus 3 model was much better.only ram & rom is higher otherwise OnePlus 3 was really good one.
"For the first time i faced an issue with one plus. Gets charged very fast but also gets drain very fast. Heating issue is continuous whenever we update, upload, use camera or any app for sometime. Everytime it gets heated i feel like please don't blast."
"This is my first Oneplus phone and i am really impressed with oneplus.Phone build Quality is very good, feels handy phone, perfect in one hand use.Smooth UI, Camera is nice, battery life is good with 65 wt charging support, good enough for 1 day.Display quality is awesome.Sound quality is very nice, with oneplus bullet z awesome sound.Gaming experience is good, with normal 60 fps smooth gameplay on BGMI.Thanks to Oneplus & Amazon for offers."
"Charges really fast, 20% to 100% in 10 mins.Phone performance is phenomenal: feels like a flagship in day to day use.90Hz screen is really smooth, but a rare stutter still happens now and then.Dual speaker system is almost symmetrical.Even with the 8GB RAM, I’m often greeted by an empty home screen when swiping up from heavy apps."
Fully satisfying product received. Loving it. Only disappointed because of delayed delivery for prime customer. I had purchased prime membership only because of this product so that is should be delivered in time and all satety measures they will take but poor packaging by Amazon. Afterall We are purchasing costly mobile so it's packiging shuld be good to safeguard the phone. So 4* for only phone 1* less for disappointments from Amazon.
"Bad battery back up - won't even last one day without another charging between the day. large charging brick- hard to carry aroundPro's are; fast charging- you can take a warm bath and your phone will be sufficiently charged, that's what impressed me than anything in this phone."
I'll say go to flipkart and buy the Motorola edge instead of this mediocre phone. One plus has settled. UI is buggy and that's what you will never expect from a OnePlus device. That's what oxygen os stood for. Now things are shifting to color os and you can see the difference very evidently. And it's not very nice.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Not been a month and phone hangs alot and hardly apps we use on a daily bases. Even while charging we feels the model nord 2 heats, looking back on blast cases of the same model we are afraid to use it."
Everything is perfect except the wide angle camera pics seems desaturated.No cost EMI is myth they are giving extra discount and then charging 1.3333% interest. Great phone if you buy with exchange offer.Phone is not water resistant as per one plus.
"This is the second one plus device I bought. First one is the Nord and Now Nord 2.Nord 2 is the Out standing phone all the features are good like night mode camera, screen display and touch screen and also performance BUT there is one problem which is SOUND, there is no base, just a loud sound , when you play any video or music you can feel the sound vibration in your hand. If they add Nord 1 speaker in Nord 2 then there will be no issue.Review by Aj."
Giving review after using 8 months. Worst part of this phone is it hangs during calls for 10-15 seconds every time. One can confirm with all users of this phone you know. Avoid buying this phone.
"I have read many comments for this product on Amazon. I was afraid to buy the OnePlus Nord2 mobile by seeing all these comments. All my queries have been cleared from Amazon online support. Then, I got the confidence to buy this phone.I am writing this review after usage of 1 month. This mobile is simply superb. Performance is excellent. The camera quality is excellent. I am not a heavy user, so getting good battery life(approx 36 hours).I would recommend this phone if your budget allows it."
"Sirf name uche kam chhote... I am not happy👎👎👎phone finger print bhi shi se kam nhi krta,,,phone garm bhi bhout hota h... Front camera atk jata h... Social media pe live karne pe bhi camera atk jata h... sirf back camera thik h... amoled display sirf name ka h... Company khati h ki 15m me full charge hojayega but 25m lgta h,,,phone ka adopter bhi bhut grm ho jata h etc...👎👎👎"
"It's an overall beast, sexy in hand feel, awesome pics, vids capture, super fast 30 mins 0-100% charging, top of the line hardware in unmatched price and unbeatable performance from any phone under 40k. Shop without any second thought, trust me you will thank me for this."
"If you are using anything below One Plus 7 and looking for an upgrade, you can go for this. It is not 100% One Plus feel. But it's a good phone. Lil bugs here and there but I guess they'll be fixed in updates. Front camera is 32 MP, but my One plus 7- 16MP was better. Low light results are average. Feel is good and almost premium. Decent Phone for 30K."
"I have been using this phone for 11 months and the phone software issues.. Bluetooth, WiFi, hotspot doesn't work properly, before connecting I have to restart my phn everytime, and Bluetooth turned off automatically while using.  Frankly speaking I have wasted my 30k rs. If camera is your main requirement then do not go for this phone. Rare camera picture is ok but video quality and selfie in indoor condition is worst and video stability is also horrible.. I'm just crying after buying this phone.. bette go for any ph rupees 20k,Your 10k will be saved."
I bought this phone 5 month ago since then I've been in service center twice due to hang problem. It started hanging after a week. Service did rest/formet the phone which I could have done it. Everytime my data gets lost they don't care. Reset tbe phone is not solution. I would suggest not to buy this phone.
"The only reason for cutting that one star is because the camera app and the system settings aren't the familiar one plus systems, rather they are more like the oppo system.I understand the motivation behind doing this, but these two are generally the most distinguishing and punchline apps of the one plus eco system. Not that the apps are bad or non functional or buggy as such, it's just a direct comparison."
I experienced the selfie camera is badLacks frequent updates
"Battery Drain was fast . After using last 2 days and full charge for some time & enable all battery optimization settings . Reduce refresh rate 60khz . Its look good backup & less battery draining now. But Cammer AI environment is not good . Its making every image as animated . You find this issue after 2x,5x zoom of camera images . I feel its not giving you original clear image . Previous technology like pixel breking after zoom was much better than current animated AI effects . OnePlus should looks into it."
"Posting this review after using the phone for 15 days.Phone heats up alot while using camera app or while playing games. Already heard a couple of news of Nord2's explosion, which is very scary.Camera quality is not good, images are not sharp and get lot of softness in the photos.Battery backup is not good, can last only upto 5-6hrs.Charging speed is very fast however battery doesn't last for long.Really disappointed with this phone at this price range."
Battery is not that great but it's fine for whole day. Bug while making video. It records the video but doesn't save it sometimes. You just have to restart the phone. If you don't ram boost your mobile then it won't run your games properly. Little bit of heating issues. Overall i think this is going to cause trouble in long run. Although phone is nice and fast but there are a lot of bugs in the phone.
"Do not waste your money on this product.Bought OnePlus Nord2 in the month of August 2021 , it's not even 6months yet , the phone isn't working properly. So many problems are arising,1.software bug2.video enhancement problem3.call quality is horrible ( with full network)4 .While playing any video , the video is getting stuck and the audio is playing in the background.5. Not able to update my software"
"Performance, screen, battery, charging speed all good.6.4 inch is perfect size.Best midrange device.Though it's color os beneath oxygen launcher, it doesn't affect majority of people.In my opinion, they should not merge oxygen os with color os. Oxygen is MVP of OnePlus phones."
"Product is good but since nothing is perfect, this product also has some issue.below are the issues:1)Some times , no incoming and no outgoing call occurs,  despite of good network connection.  but after re-start it will start working fine2)whats app notification will not pop up at top bar.3)call automatically diconnectes sometimes.4)When browsing reels on instagram,  many videos gets stuck.  note: it's not because of internet.  even if we have good internet connection reels stuck sometimes"
"My first experience with this phone is I heard that one plus phone never gets hot, never hangs but I have to see all these things. In just 15 days, the phone started hanging and while playing games at 50% brightness.  By playing games together, the phone becomes very hot within 15 minutes, up to 42 degrees, I am afraid that I should not go on my feet. Missed audio Jake a lot."
"Its live bomb, scared to use it now. Please refund, many people seeing blast.Very Fast, everything is niceBut camera is total artificial all images are beautified to look nice... So dont expect real clarity... Otherwise camera sensor also nice... But pixel and purane onplus jaise clean photos nahi aate"
"Phone seems to have heating issue which I never faced in one plus 6.If you use the camera for sometime phone heats up ,you are out in sun same thing happens even if you don't use it much."
"The first phone i got, had major issues like fingerprints sensors were not working properly, had heating issues near the camera while the phone was not used for an hour or so. The camera was not so decent, battery drained quickly.. i got it replaced with a new one and this second phone is working properly without any issues that's mentioned above."
Today I have bought first time one plus mobile and not happy much. I just put the mobile on charge and immediately it heated and camera rufse to open because of heat.Battery ending very fast as compare to my old mobile that too using for more than one year.Don't know what to do
"I'm posting this review after two weeks of using this phone.PROS :Good in hand feelLooks like flagship OP 9Fluid DisplayGreat Battery Life ( can charge from 0 to 100 % in 35 mins)----------------CONS :Not a purely Oxygen OS ( Color OS changes in settings, camera app)Dialer app is now replaced with Google Dial ( not good for VC using Jio )No Dolby AtmosCamera is not up to the mark. ( Gets a slight bluish tone)"
Phone is good but not worth the money u are payingXiaomi phones are the bestProsGood primary cameraFast charging works goodConsFront camera is badPhone will hang sometimesNot as fast as other phones in this range
I moved from MI to oneplus. The hardware is definitely and upgrade from MI but the software is the worst. So many issues in the software I have not yet been able to figure out a lot of unnecessary features on this phone. Some features are extremely irritating. The phone goes into to DND mode automatically when you are in car. I feel like throwing this phone away.
"not happy after buy expensive product.Battery draining problemHeating  problemNo android 12 updates till nowSo many bugsSelfie camera not goodNo audio playerBasic video playerNo theme customization.all over they used google application every where like message, call, photos and many place only google app used."
When i open cameras . It auto closes . Battery is not that much good . I loved the camera and bought . But its just ordinary camerA. No great one plus touch in it. Need the process suddenly closes . And it making a auto restart Every a on a day . To tally fcuked up . By this mobile . Too bad and sad . Any help . I bought on prime day . Any one give a suggest to me.
If you are a very big fan of OnePlus and want best user experience then go for it!And If you want rantings from my side then for1. User experience 4/52. Screen quality 4.5/53. Battery 4/54. Charging speed 5/55. Haptic feedback 4/56. Camera 📷 2/57. In hand feeling 4.5/58. Value for money 3.5/59. Overall 3/5Note: If you want a camera centric phone then this phone is not for you! Otherwise approx everything is good 👍
"One of the worst phone, there is no quality comparison even with 6T, one plus drastically reducing its quality after every new model, so I switched to Apple iPhone 11 , Nord2’s battery is worst, OS is worst, Amazon requesting you to accept this Chinese  phone  in exchange at least as am planning to buy one more iPhone."
"I give 4 star to OnePlus Nord 2 5G. 1 star is remaining for heating issue .When I use OnePlus Nord 2 5G for 1 hour , the device heated up to 40°C.  While playing BGMI the CPU and battery temperature reaches to 43 to 46°C . This is the major issue I seen in OnePlus Nord 2 5G. Another feacters are awesome . Camera is op. OnePlus provide the best camera in Nord 2 . Everything is best , better and good. But the major problem is heating . I hope OnePlus solve this problem too quickly in next software update."
Ok so let's talk about camera Quality.OnePlus Nord 2 camera is awesome but abhi ruko if you are useing  50 MP camera so after clicking one picture you need to wait for 5 minutes because your camera automatically turn off and you are not able to use camera againe for 5 minutes and I am sure after one month I'll share my full reviewThanks
My phone is heating too much just in 10 to 15 min of use. And I am using just regular apps. Battery is also draining so fast. I need to charge in every 7 to 8 hours.It is also lagging. It takes few seconds to open any menu either it is phone app menu or sharing menu.
"Phone looks premium and glossy finish and comes with TPU case and a normal tempered glass for display and back side aswell. The camera looks so good. Speakers are so loud. No front flash light and external memory card slot. With first impression it's good for 30k segment which has every option like NFC, 5G, good camera and sensor.  Best mid range phone."
Issue 1: AE/AF Lock feature. This function works only on a default value and cannot be locked on your desired set value.Issue 2: Turning on 50MP camera. This camera sensor works only on 4:3 ratio and not 16:9 or full screen.
"Initially the camera and everything was pretty good. Now after a couple of months the camera is not that good, phone full of bugs, and the major problem is the battery life. It drains so so fast, pretty much problematic for a journeys. I could get better phones with 30k. I bought this phone mostly for camera, but it's camera also not up to mark after few months. And this phone hangs toooo much. Highly disappointed with OnePlus."
"Leverages :- Fast Charging, touch response very quick, smooth colours, stunning camera quality, noice cancellation works well in noisy area, 2 years of android update and 3 years security patches updateDrawbacks :- bettery drainage, screen little bit lag some times, little bit heavy in weight, service center staff less attentive"
"Screen Touch Interface is not functioning at all times, particularly , when selecting a file for Caller Tune and when one has to reach back to last screen/frame by touching the arrow on left hand side top corner below the Selfie Camera, even after cleaning fingers again and again. It was a waste of time to have a device not functioning properly on the very first day."
Finger print is awesome and the battery is also very good using it from yesterday only charged phone once and still I have 75 % of battery life I'm at a heavy user I'm a normal user and camera is very good..day shots and night shots really come very good
"Ive used Oneplus 3 for 3+ years before I've upgraded to Reno 2. I was a Oneplus lover and that's why I came back to Oneplus family after 2 years, But frankly speaking, I'm really disappointed with the performance. Sometimes the phone is hanging. Sometimes it's too slow. This started happening from day 1. Even though I'm impressed wjth the battery life and charging speed, I'm very sad with overall performance. Heating badly if we play any games."
Hi friends I was having MI phones using different MI phones for last few yearsthis year I tried oneplus my experience with oneplus is not good it's having extremely low battery life that will not last for even half day and have you will have to do multiple chargingThough it charges fast but still you need to carry heavy bulky charger with you all the time
Camera -One of worst camera experience.It just stop working all of a sudden and you got stuck in middle of no where.just pathetic not expected this type of camera experience.Mobile Phone sometimes gets heat up and you can feel it.
"The apps are hanging and and working super slow, need to restart the phone everytime while facing this issue. Restarting the phone twice or thrice everyday. Basic apps are performing poorly.I wish if I could get a refund of this phone."
Front camera quality is not upto the mark. It's worse than mi selfie cameras. But rear camera quality is much better. Another major drawback is worst battery life. Not satisfied at all..
After 6 days of use.The camera quality is awesome . . Playing games like battlegrounds seems unreal because of the framerate and high resolution graphics without any kind of lag..But the main thing that has blown me away is the Charging speed... It gets charged from fully drained to full in just half hour. . Even if it has some charge left it will take even less time to charge.. Battery life is quite good. . Goes for a full day with just a half hour charge.I'll update if something comes up!!
If anyone Says it blasts or Heats they are just Dumps.I'm using it for a month it never heated when usage just small amount of warm as it geting charge as its having the Fast charging capability.Great product...With nice features and Great look.If you just Want a OnePlus and don't mind money then just go for it...Go and buy 12GB variant...
OnePlus Nord 2 mobile :  Warp charging is superb and 40 minutes in 100% full charged .Charging quickly decrease inthe time of 6 hovers continue videos watched . camara is good  and fingerprint sensor retrieve late. processor and performanceis good.3.5 mm not given big minus in this phone andAmazon service is nice.Free flip case(mobile gaurd) not good and can't properly adjust setup on screen guard.6gb ram mobile not available I suffered. I buy 8 GB ram mobile.Mobile Very fastI feel really good.
"Processor slow...camera takes time to process image...to forward image more then 10 it's takes 10 second to select and give option to forward, showing whatsapp msgs on screen after selecting hide notification also.not happy with the product :)"
"OnePlus is one of the best mobile after apple , I purchase nord2 for my sister, no words to express it's just awesome elegant mobile . I have been using OnePlus5 for last 5 years ,I would say OnePlus simply the best overall ."
I bought this phone thinking that it would be a great purchase after a long time. But I am not happy as it's hanging lots of time everyday. I don't know how long I will be using this phone more. And I would give a second thought to buy this phone once again.
Charge krte wakt bohot problem arahe kabhi slow charge hojata to kabhi fast. Care me dene ke bad bhi iska koi solution nahi mila (OnePlus sarvice centre in nagpur. ) Bohot kharab experience raha . Call receive krte vakt kabhi kabhi hang hojata hai
"Worst phone of oneplus, earlier i was using OnePlus 5t ,that was Amazing phone but all the nord variants are worst phone by OnePlus, no auto call recording features as in OnPlus5t, lot of hanging issues , if your storage increase more than 100gb out of 256 gb, it will be super slow, seems like after collaboration with oppo, it has been wost product now"
"Loved the colour of the phone! Loved the specification of the phone! The touch screen is sooooo smooth, I am just loving it! And the camera is just too good!"
The phone is very good. If your priority is clean UI go for this Camera is way better then previous nord.bettery backup is goood. And 65 w fast chargee charges phone 0-100 in 20-30 minutes.There are some unnecessary permissions also appears due to oppofication you can see glimpse of color os.If your main purpose is gaming then go for the POCO and for camera Oppo reno has better camera then nord 2 if you don't have clean UI as priority.
"Guys, everyone nowdays thinking of oneplus is alternative for samsung. I used samsung for 4 years and funskky bought nord2. When I bought this I thought of same but for geninure review I'm here1. it's not worth for money.2. Many software issues. (Apps are not opening properly after installation )3. Camera quality and batter life was poor4. Basic options are not available ( fonts, locks screen options and many more )This is my 3rd day but it was not worth my best advice not go with this. If you still it's upto you."
Im happy with the purchase. Delivery was smooth.Good  battery 🔋 lifeInterface is clean and smoothIn hand feel is amazingSupports fast chargingThanks Amazon and team for such a great product
"Google dialer down point of this phone, nahi hona chahiye kisi bhi phone me, sirf 15 din use karke olx par sell Kar diya Maine isko sirf aur sirf Google dialer ki wajah se,Google bahut bada down point Hai Sabhi phones ke liye"
Great in hand fill.looks premium. BUTafter 2 days of usage I apply for return. Camera crashes every time after 3 to 4 min use. after opening dual mode pano and all other modes phone gets hang. then close the camera by itself as I open it again it gets close again and again.. and hit like hell.... one plus...this is worst experience..I want to return this phone.. regreating about why I choose this on Samsung.
"Nord's selfie camera is one of the worst I've seen!! It's a waste! I don't have any problems with the phone but this selfie camera issue is one thing that i need to be fixed ASAP. My Nokia phone had far better selfie camera than Nord 2... Its such a disgrace for a phone like oneplus to have a camera like this!And yes it has a bit of heating issues but not a thing to be worried about!...Please, Oneplus if you care about your customers, fix it!"
The way we listen about oneplus is a big brand I don't think it's like that it's nothing a big name it's a normal name as well as rest of the 20k to 25k phones. It's better to buy some other phone not only for the brand oneplus. When a company gets popular its always give worst product same situation with oneplus. 1st ly big mistake was nord in this phone there is no such features which has been oneplus always knows for that so after all it's not the overall but the lowest rating phone I think s
I got it for my dad.. we are all OnePlus fans. We don't use this for extensive gaming or photography . Phone is smooth as butter. No unwanted bloatware. .Good .. simple and fast. my dad loves it
Battery stands for 5-6hrs even though I don't play games. I use only whatsapp & calls
The camera is not at all up to the mark as its claims!
Hardware specs are awesome. For me I shifted from OnePlus 6T to Nord 2. So I feel it a bit bulkier. Phone dialer app is from Google and it announces when calls are auto recorded. I would prefer old OnePlus phone dialer which am not able to side load yet.Rest all it works fine and is a flagship killer!!!
"3months and this phone started showing rapid battery drain issue, heating issue is just there however you use it. Camera is glitchy sometimes focus doesn't work gives a blurred pic.If everything works right the pic is good it takes time and heats up phone too much. Gaming is out of question half hour of highend games make it soo hot you can't hold on to it.Overall bad phone too pricey not much is gained apart from fast charging."
Pros:1.Deaign is excellent2.Performance is good3.Screen has awesome views.4.Charging is super fast.Cone:1.Battery draining too fast.2.Fingerprint should be more accurate.3.In hand feels too sileperry.
"Phone looks premium. Touch response is very good , processor very good , no hang , camera also superb. Battery backup good , charging very fast so covers the little small battery. Battery could be 5000mah but cud have resulted in higher weight. Phone UI is good . Little different from last used Real UI. Can go for it. Priced a little costly. At 25000 best buy."
"Now it's more than 10 days I am using this phone, I am not a heavy user, but below are my observations:Pros 1) Camera (bigeest plus point of this phone)2) Fast charging (like in 15 minutes 100%)3) Battery (Easily works 2 days for me)4) Display (amazing display quality)Cons 1) In display finger print scanner (I find it sometimes not quick enough)2) Sometimes I felt that the mobile is heatingBut overall a decent or more than decent mobile phone in this price."
"Product is good but after 20 days of delivery product not operating okay.At the time of listening the music & volume button press for inceasing the volume device swittched off automatically aslo when incoming call time device switched off.After that 2 time I had visit the authorized service center but both time center is closed due to software upgradation process.Hence, after buying this product I had faced big trouble & till time issue not resolved.product is good but in short time device find problematic."
100% Phone will get damaged..be ready to spend.Back cover got damaged just using 2 months. Charges are Rs. 2600+ GST.Beware while talking to the customer care.They make you trouble lot.You need to beg being their customer.Great behaviour.No value for customer money.
"If you are really interested to buy I can suggest you to buy oppo f19 pro 5g, because only the back camera appearance is same, the OS and internal interference everything same. You can buy it under 23k."
"Nord 2 comes with dimensity 1200 which is flagship processor. GAMING IN THIS MOBILE IS ALSO GOOD YOU CAN EASILY GET 60FPS IN BGMI. All daily task are very smooth. It has 6 5g bands which makes him future proof smartphone.Camera of this smartphone  is very good,low light performance of camera is also good. It fully charged by 66watt fast charging in 30min. Haptic feedback, design, fingerprint sensor, speaker,90hz refresh rate , all are good.I don't find any problems with this phone.This phone is all rounder phone and worth your money."
"I rated the phone low because of its intrusive and ridiculous permission approach. The one plus apps like camera, recorder do not start if I don't give phone permission. If I deny a permission, certain features should be disabled; not deny to run the app. I would have given a rating of 0 just for this approach to customer intrusion; but unfortunately Amazon does not all me to do so"

 Best Under 30k OnePlus Nord 2 Main Processor 8GB Ram is k FingerPrint reader normal, but they give only 128 storage is normal, Battery 🔋 Drain Fastely if use normal brightness with 15 or 20min use drain faster Resolve the issue Kindly and Camera 📷 Quality is good Front flashlight is not going given, Earphone option not there, comparison of 1+ CE, 7,7T,8,8T & 9 is good Overall Performance good 10 Star I give 8."
OnePlus was my dream phones so was scared to invest 30k but since after buying these is one of the best phone ever had it been year i guess but phone is still so smooth and yes this is my first Amazon reviews ever i sl promised myself to review it only after the use of 6 months  best for gaming i tried all trending games all files camera video everything OnePlus is a brand 💯
"My last phone was one plus 7, and that was pretty good, but this phone is horrible (12gb version). Every thing is horrible,as its built qualy,screen resolution, touch, camera, UI with lot of bugs. You will regret it after buying it ( as i m regretting).This phone is good for first time 'one plus' users. Better go for iphone XR with exctra ₹5-6k."
Overal phone was good but the display is pathetic it just slowly fall down from a very minor height even not more than 2 ft but the screen broke away. They mention it as gorilla glass but I don't think they have provided any screen protection on it. Please be careful about the screen protection.
Not worth of 30k for sure.. battery is draining fast without much activity..I hardly use my phone .. unnecessarily I switched from iPhone.. there are many good features though and it’s easy to configure and use.. very expensive affair
Don't purchase this OnePlus ...if u purchase definitely u r money will bes waste ....if want good product just go for #Samsung A52s
Not worth it.Camera video stability is very poor.my older samsung phone of 17k was far better for that.Battery drains quick.Things which I likeQuick charging helps lot.Camera portrait mode is very good.For me camera video stability was most important but this disappoints me lot rest everything is fine.. spending 35k is not worth for it.
Ive been having amazing expreience with the phone untill i encountered a scratch on the screen despite the fact that its a gorilla glass. I feel disappointed. Ive never encountered scratch even on cheaper samsung phones n ive used them without tampered glass... Battery life is poor. On heavy usage it doesnt last 6 hrs which is saved by 65watt charger.The only con is the battery life and poor screen quality
I am using Nord 2 since last 2 months and I have not felt any issues like hang and battery draining. But few application like Instagram can be little tough to use in it because I am unable to post any video on it. All over I can say phone is awesome specially the speed and camera.
"The worst part was i wasn't allowed to review this product till 1.5 months from my purchase. To avoid customers getting the right feedbackCamera quality is highly poor. All images are pixelated once you start zooming, yes i am talking about 1.5x zoom also.Ease of use - poorNot worth the money"
"Intially for a week, phone was working properly, but now it is not working.It automatically gets switched off.And stays off for a long, after some time it get restarted and then again same.It feels like phone is a person getting on and off depending on its mood.Very disappointed.And for warranty service, it is not showing anything.Amazon is not supporting warranty service, then why say there is a warranty period of 1 year.Looking for help."
"After reading blasting news about this phone, i tried contacting one plus. They replied that our products go through mandatory quality checks, and are safe to use.But then what about the units that blasted?Now i am too scared to use this will be selling this off soon.I suggest you to buy quality product of some other brand and not waste your money on this."
"Wakeup command is not working in Alexa. Inbuilt Alexa feature is written on it but when I call customer care, they said that this feature is not available in OnePlus Nord 2 only tap and say options is available. I don't know why they mention inbuilt Alexa feature in it"
"Phone is good but u will be disappointed with some features of it, like google dialer only , u will not be able to record call without notification, other party will always know u r recording call, and then some news also came as Nord 2 exploding. It's not good If were knew about recording notification I wud have never bought it . Really disappointed"
• Amazing phone .• It's comes with a feel good factor and feels  good in hand .• Great display that comes with amoled and  90Hz refresh rate .• superb Mediatek Dimensity 1200 AI processor  gives you a high end performance .• Camera 📷 is fantastic .• 65W warp charger takes around 40-45 minutes to fully charged the phone .•^^^ Only thing is that the phone last only one.  day with a full charge .
"I expected a better camera (especially, the front camera is horrible, the back camera is quite good, but could have been better) and a little more lag free experience. Perhaps updates can fix the camera and the slight lag on some websites. Overall the phone is good, very fast charging, good battery life, and clear signal reception. The display is quite good but seems to be very slightly white washed. I have used OnePlus 7 before this and that phone was better."
"phone speakers are very bad. when you play music or a movie, the speakers are loud but not quality speakers. the back panel is vibrating and you can't hold the phone while watching a movie or you cant keep it in the pocket while listing to music. it is vibrating like chaina local speaker. Also, I Observed a heating issue, after the update, there is no heating issue. The front camera is the worst one. 16MP Camara is far better than this. I bought is for 35K and the phone is not feeling like a premium phone. very disspointed."
"I feel so much heating issue smart phone. during 2 hour, youtube video play phone temperature goes 49 Celsius and 30% battery drain out. after heating phone start hang problem. when i hold phone in hands during video play, feels like it goes explode within some time. when phone keep in pocket, it feel warm.i visit to oneplus service centre. oneplus technician tell me that 48-49 Celsius temperature is normal. please don't waist our money on that. go for some other batter option."
"The screen will pop out like this and the phone won't be of any use. The worst part is they will claim that you have somehow got inside the phone and pulled the screen out, so it is not covered under warranty.Avoid One-Plus altogether. This is a perennial issue with One-Plus and they have not solved it yet."
"Writing review after usage of one month.Good:Battery backup around 18hrs with internet data and hotspots ON.Display gives mild for eyes.One touch finger , highly sensible.Overall nice it gives premium brand feel.Bad:Missing headphone jack feels incomplete.Heating : Furstated when we use phone camera outdoors. It is overheating."
WhatsApp VC doesn't support volume efficiently...also volume doesn't support on media platforms...have to restart the cellphone for better volume quality...Please do not but this cellphone else ur money will go in veins....Not worthy at all....I wish I could hv trouble shot the cellphone uses before the return date expires...that so loss for me....But other pls don't buy it....it's not worth it...
"The In display fingerprint sensor is really good, it has really fast response, the battery life is also impressive, I charged my phone more than 24 hrs ago and I still have 45% battery left. I cannot say much about the camera quality as I don't use it that much,there are a few bugs here and there like the gallery app or the Google phtots app does not read some folders containing pictures for 1-2 days and the AppLock also does not work several times, so these are the reasons 1 reduced 1 star. And also there is no heating issue"
Writing the review after using it for almost three months now. I purchased it as I wanted a camera centric phone and yes am satisfied with the camera performance. Ultra wide could have been better given the price. Only con which I have an issue is the battery life. It drains very easily which becomes an issue for constant user.
Fingerprint reader is not that fast. Camera quality and battery life is not good.Only pros is phone charges really fast from 0 to 100%.But still we will get better features at half the price of this mobile.Not reccomended.
Everything is so good on this phone.Pros :Great camera update from previous nord seriesGreat look and designSuper fast charging (15min 70%)Colour os in limitSmooth and fastAlert sliderGood Hepatics6 5g bandsCons :Battery needs to be charged twice for heavy usersNo 3.5mm headphone jackMinor bugs like clone videoSome minor camera issues90hz refresh rateSides made of plasticWhen charged the phone gets heatedNo ip water splash resistance certificate
"Battery backup is very disappointed,have a glitch in camera not able to menemize itI am very disappointed from oneplus. Adaptor is not working and ista out of stock since 4 months what the hell is that i don't knowThey are providing a adaptor . How do i charge my phone . Very poor service from oneplus. I will not buy any oneplus device in my life."
"Don't waste your money, Battery life is not Good, Wrap charge will full your phone and  reduce of charge also faster.I was wasted by money by buying this phone from Amazon."
"Phone look is awesome and premium quality,phone is getting little bit hot while playing pubg ,camera quality is good ,sound quality is also good,no wired headphones supported only wireless bluetooth headphone supported"
"Not properly optimised os,too many glitches.one plus please don't ruin your market by launching sub standard devices.Auto restarts, over lay of apps,auto crashing..what not..better go for other device in same price range"
"No doubts, it's a great phone.Camera quality is good specially photoes in night time is good as well.Fingerprint reader is good but not that fast.Sound quality is great. If you are looking for headphone jack, there is no headphone jack just like the OnePlus Nord.4500mAh battery is good to go almost oneday but if you are a heavy phone user, it will be around 6-7 hours. Although 65w charger is  another good thing to consider for charging your phone. It really takes 20-30min for full charge."
"Can you expect a phone with 12 GB RAM to get hanged and Blank screen , if no then buy this piece of crap and you will come to know.It hangs , Screen goes blank within 15 days of purchase.Don't waste your hard earned money on this crap and buy some other phone."
"Battery lasts really well with heavy use. Make sure that you only use the official one-plus charger that comes with it, otherwise, there might be loss in battery optimization. Camera quality, especially wide angle is good. Worth the money."
"After using for almost 1 month , I am writing this review.Excellent in each and every term and feature. Battery backup is amazing and fast charging gives 0 tension of battery running out. Selfie camera is bit i can say average , not the best but rear camera is just awesome in every aspect.Too good and smooth for daily experience and use which includes scrolling , calling , whatsapp , bit heavy apps.Built quality is also too good and comfy.Easily you can go for it for this price range ."
"Overall a good product. After using it more than a week i would say rear camera and performance is awesome but front camera is not upto the mark. Good selfie camera is the need of hour but this phone is lacking this capability. A lot of cheap phones offer bttr selfie camera than this device. display, performance and refresh rate is awesome. battery life is good. need to charge once in a day for average users. fast charging is the best thing! overall a great buy if you are not a selfie lover!!!"
"The battery of this phone is extremely bad. Though I am a mediocre user, battery drains too fast. It lasts only 2-2.5 hours in screen on mode. I got my first handset replaced thinking that particular handset is faulty. But the replacement set is even worse. One of the worst models of Oneplus."
"Fingerprint reader is very good, battery life is nice and the charger included charges in like 20 mins. Camera quality is very good, picks up very minor details. Display is very amazing, handles multitasking nicely. Does not heat up. Processor is also excellent. What more could you want...."
"Good phone for daily usage. Fast enough and good memory. Good camera, Battry lasts less and it's due to mediatek processor, good point is it charges fully in just 30 mins thanks to fast in box charger. Ui is always good in one plus phones. Feels sturdy and premium.Overall a good package go for it."
"Bought the phone last month. Camera quality is really good. Phone is good in other aspects except battery life. Drains very fast. When you are paying so much for the  phone, atleast battery life should have been good. Phone has heating problem also."
"Overall the phone works exactly as advertised..but battery could have been bigger..no doubt the battery gets fully charged from 0-100 in just 30 mints max..but it drains quicker, even if you are not a gamer"
"- Finger print reader is just pathetic.- Camera lags and hence comes with colored lines on the picture like we used to get in old TVs, also the app closes on it's own multiple times- Excessive call drop issues as it's wi-fi calls are pathetic, wifi connectivity is compromised again.- They say heavy battery but you end up charging twice in a day which was not case in old OnePlus devices.- Again poor customer services"
Pros* Buttery smooth experience* Excellent rear camera* Fast battery charging (0-100 % ~ in 40 mins)* Dual 5G portsCons* Poor quality selfie camera* Display not up to the mark* Dual apps not supported* Battery draining fast when heavy load applications are in use
I'm using Nord 2 for last 5 days.overall experience is great.Battery backup one day if normal user but charging speed is superb full charge within 40 min. Display is great. Now camera quality is good.front camera is nice indoor n outdoor photography but rear camera is strugling for indoor photography.but for outdoor photography it's very nice.3.5mm jack is not available that is con.overall value for money.
Its nice camer and very good display but I'll given 1star is very irritating issues battery draining very fast day 5 times I will recharge
Overall performance is good. Capture photos in night very awesome.Pros.Camera SuperbPerformance very goodOxygen OS is goodDisplay AwesomeCons.Battery life is averageHeating issuesConnectivity problem with wifi
I am purchase one plus Nord 2 & one plus buds zPhone is  good  priceBut Nord buds z is very costly to Amazon 2899.00Nord buds z is selling in one plus Red cable site only 1499.00I am loss 1300.00 is very sad 😭Don't  purchase Amazon site
"Pros : Good phone with the budget that earlier one plus used to come .Everything is fine , processor , camera , display , dual speaker , connectivity , gaming all cool.Con : price is because of brand name and ok for budget as recently compared with the other phones of one plus.The base variant is not available that is bad at one scenario .all colours are not available ."
"Purchased the phone after going through several reviews and now after using for 1Month, reviewing it.1. Finger print is Fast2. Phone is smoothly running & feels flagship killer in hand.3. Camera is good.4. Battery backup is ok.5. No lag issues found"
Lots of bugs inside device one plus company is no more giving good services as before they brought some software update in all user phone so they can get new phone and now when they launched one plus nord 2 I buyed exchanging my old device but now seriously they are literally making fool to people they are doing cheating no use of wasting money behind this product lots of bugs application crash it just been 5 days I had buyed this phone so to all audience I will suggest not to take this phone my personal experience
"Writing this review after 2 days, 90Hz is enough camera is the best thing and after update it has Bokeh Flare Portrait feature and camera has gotten better and better.BGMI can be played Smooth- ExtremeAnd Ultra with rest upto HDR.Warp Charging very fast job done in 32 mins....In display fingerprint is good sometimes took a sec...Battery Life could be better but fast charging compensates it.Camera quality exceeded my expectations"
Very Good product.....!Camera quality is so goodCharging is also mind blowing the phone is charge 0 to100% in just 27 minutes.Fingerprint reader works also so fast.And the display quality is also good and smooth.And the 90 hz experience is 🔥All over the one plus is a oneplus 🔥 no one beat this monster........!#oneplus #oneplus_india #nord #nord2
"My first purchase over a 20k worth of phone. I must say worth spending this 30k with an amazing exchange of Oppo A5 (5500). The look and feel is super cool and light weighted too . The only small disaapointment is no head phone jack you have to use a Bluetooth headset , though that can be managed with a converter which i did.Super fast charging . Super camera quality with the highest zoomed one . Even a small pimple pigmentation is also very much visible😭"
No battery heating issue my  phoneAnd no any other problems
GenuinelyCamera quality - The best with great night mode camera feature. Front camera is not too good.Sound Quality is too GoodScreen performance is GoodBattery life is Average and mobile get quite heat while watching video or playing game for long time.Battery can run for one full day with average internet usage and video watching.
"The overall performance of the phone is great. But it has so many bugs. Sometimes while gaming the screen glitches out ,freezes the game very badly for 4-5 seconds. The look,design ,in hand feel, camera along with UI is great but batttery life is not that good. Plus oneplus should give the phones faster android updates."
I didn't like it's heating behaviour.Camera is not so good in this price range.Overall the features and the working of this mobile is satisfactory.
"Amazon sends defective product to its customer. It's such an expensive phone and Amazon is cheating it's customer by sending a phone which has defect on the screen. It is also not replacing the product although it mentions that replace window is open for 7 days, but not actually replacing the defective product.Such a horrible and disappointing experience. ****Never spend your money on buying expensive phones on Amazon***"
"Yes,mobile is good and the experience of the os is also good and we can notice the performance between our old to this moble, but as I expected battery life is not at the mark,and mono camera is bad, premium look this mobile was giving and also disine,I think this mobile was use full for the all round coustomers.and my experience is exlent,"
Nord 2 Kharid Ne K Bad Hi Kuch Time Me Otometik Switched off and hang Ho Jata He Processor slow Laga Kafi Struggle Karta He Dont Buy Don’t waste your money
Camera result and the colours are disappointing. Colours look very unrealistic. Also the software doesn't process selfie photos well. Software is not well integrated with this new mediatek processor. Not a upgrade for me at least. However the phone feels premium in hand.
"Cam is too bad, im not expecting a high performance but 🤷🤷🤦 it's not good in that range.. ... If u had a habit of buying product considering only the brand value. U should stop considering "" ONE PLUS "". 🥴"
"Oneplus nord2 is didn't touched the expectations. The software was worst and buyed the phone for smooth experience. But onplus oxygen os getting hanged. 30k phone with dimensity 1200 ai processor and 8gb ram with 128gb rom Latest phone brought recently 5 days back now, the story is like it's getting hang and slow performance. Don't buy products from Amazon beacuse they just telling promising agreements like return policy for  advertising only ."
Pros :1. The primary camera is awesome2. Sound is terrific3. Day to day usages are pretty good as it's powered by dimensity1200AI4. AI powered camera optimization5. 65W super fast chargingCons :1. Battery could have been better2. Telephoto lens could be added3. Metal side framing instead of plastic one4. Center punch hole camera looks more beautiful than side punch hole.
"Review after one month. Fast charging is really amazing, full charges within 20 minutes. No heat issue( not a big fan of games). Excellent clean ui. Camera is really good. Night pdotos are excellent. Best phone ever used. Compact handy phone. But weight is little high."
ProsDecent performanceExcellent photographySoftware experience still the bestSuperfast 65W chargingConsMono sensor not very usefulScreen brightness could be betterLow-light photography needs improvement
"I chose OnePlus Nord 2 over POCO F3 because i got it for 25k. Almost the same price of Poco F3 GT after CC discount. Also, I was bored using the MIUI constanty for 3 years so had to switch to oxygen OS for a clean android experience.Camera quality is good.Oxygen OS is smooth.Almost the same features as MIUI.No ads & bloatware65w charges full in 30mins.Good sound quality."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 First time I purchased oneplus, really disappointed with this type of phone from oneplus. When I try to take a photo it's showing SD Card error camera is temporarily unavailable, when I tried to backup file its showing no internal storage Found, I made a complaint & I got replacement. Which I got new phone ,its not switching on, Showing the serial is not match fastboot_unlock_verify of, I tried to charge also,but it's not charging, now I requested for refund."
I am writing thus review after continously usage for 4-5 hours...Good:My first impression was impressive...It does a pretty job in terms of holding experience... Feels premium.... Display is decent enough.... 90hz works fine in daily life.... Charging is superfast... Camera is great but not consistent....Bad :Phone heats a little while using...And it comes with wifi 6 but still not connecting with my 5ghz router... May be it can be fixed with updates...
"Charging cable is missed from the box & not a Sealed boxWhile charging heat issue means too much heat I feel today(4/8/2021)1: charging 15% to 100% time 33mins2: heat issue while playing pubg it's around 43ç3: battery backup issue , it's drain fastly u need to charge 4 to 5 time heavy usage4: Performance ok5: read mode not available6: back side protect not good7: too much heat issuePros1: network speed is good 4g+2: camera is okay"
"Camera is very good, I was more than satisfied.I'm not a heavy gamer, but a multimedia consumer. This phone does the job well in it.The only negative I felt about phone was, it was a bit bulkier and heavy."
"At first the battery wasn't holding. Now after a week, the battery is holding too good. The front camera clocks some decent pictures in sufficient light conditions but when the light is dim, it's horrible like a cheap chinese phone. Many UI and performance tweaks needed. Design is too awesome. Rest everything is fine and hoping to get everything even better with updates."
"Flagship grade processor (Mediatek dimensity 1200 handles everything you throw at it with ease), Great display (The 90hz AMOLED display produces truly vibrant colours), impeccable cameras (Sony IMX 766 and the overall tuning hits it out of the park be it outdoor or low light conditions) & incredibly fast charging (65 watt warp charger is super quick)."
I like phone its a awesome phone. I have 2 same phone and I am not getting battery backupp of one for other. Only getting half of other. I think battery is not fine for my phone.
The phone is amazing but with some flaws. The main issue that bothered me was its front facing camera. Its worse. Looked like a 10k phones image. Was expecting more at this price range. But rest of the phone is absolutely amazing.
"I m using this phone from one month. Want to say some things.1.warp charger is very awesome2. Battery life is average, I m not a heavy user till battery drains from 10 am to 8 pm3. Back main camera is so good. Video quality is very good4. Selfie camera also good but 4k recording not available.5. Phone is heating while playing game, but not feeling so hot.6. Screen quality is good7. Performance is so good, good processor"
"Using this phone from last 3 month, this phone has lot of issue like voice recoder, Facebook and YouTube video play features wil not work fine...etc this was my first one plus phone 30k range and really disappointed 😞 no value for money"
"Burning like sun,too much heat.Will update you after blast"
This is my first One plus device and I love it..Camera is really awesome 🤩🤩..Battery 🔋 life is ok but the charger we get I can't tell how fast ⏩⏩ in Just minutes it's charged..OS and display are also 🔥🔥🔥🔥..Also handy phone 🤳🤳..Again this is legit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Battery life is less compared to other mobiles in the Market but we can sustain by keeping the mobile in Power saving mode. Other features are very good . Camera is exceptional.
"First @oneplus thank you for awesome product and also the amazon for your delivery and packaging. Worth for money if you are normal user. if you are gamer, This mobile may not suit for you. Touch response, refresh rate is so nice to handle.1. weightless2. Superb performance overall3. No heating😊4. Good camera quality😍5. Fast charging in 20-40 minsCons:-Battery capacity is low"
Hi TeamNow after 3 months of use I am able to see that that phone hangs or gets into freeze mode Some times you click on few features it takes time to action. Suggest be careful and evaluate before buying I am quite disappointed.
"Camera quality, fingerprint reader, quick charging everything looks good. Don't hesitate to grab it, you will not be disappointed."
Pretty good smartphone for this price.......best camera in this price range......Some cons that 8 have noticed are....Battery life is not up to the mark.....you will get 5hr sot in typical daily usageOxygen os new version has some jitters and inconsistencies....but I hope that future updates will sort out this problem.Overall I can say that it is one of the best smartphone in this price bracket......especially if you are looking for amazing cameras.
Camera - 5/5Sound -5/5Screen - 5/5Handling- 5/5Worth 30K.Now or Never you will be settle
"Phone hangs, if opening whatsapp from notification window, screen hangs. Calling using wifi is pathetic..receiver not able to hear clearly..6 GB 6T performs better than this 8GB.. external speakers volume is  also less than desired..you remove phone during call from ear to look into screen , need to juggle to put it live.. overall disappointed 🙁"
"Software is broken, Especially after Oppo integration just too many bugs. For some context I am switching back to OnePlus after a long time.I tried a simple thing to enable dual app for whatsapp on my new Nord2 phone I went to settings -> App Management -> App cloner. LoL!! This is what I see, there are no apps to choose, rather a description what app cloner does."
"Call recorder is an utter joke in this Nord 2, it only records my voice and not the person on the other side of the call...Then what's the purpose of call recorder!! Pathetic phone...never buy this One Plus Nord 2. Never going to buy another One Plus mobile."
Voice of Call recorder is not a good sign for privacy so I suggest to remove or change it when phone will be upgraded also there are not showing where can we received messages from Sim-1 or Sim-2 due to this we are not traced messages in message Box  it's also blander Bug in this Category phones.Again suggest to you both are showing bad experience so please take on priority and resolve both bugs.
Front camera not good as this price range....lack of image processing...photo gets blur or whitish in front camera....need update to resolve this issuesSome dents found on device which is invisible normaly quality issues there in every handsetOther wise excelent performance excelent build quality nice phone.....
"The AMOLED Display is so amazing. The 90Hz feels so smooth. Optimized so well. The charging speed is blazingly fast I must say. Battery backup is pretty decent will last for a day with single charge on normal usage, no complains. The Camera is awesome, specially the night mode. Video is super smooth. The sound quality OMG, its a mini Stereo Home Theatre. Crispy Clear and Loud. Overall this is so value for money. Well Done OnePlus. Truely satisfied."
"Good software experience.High speed charging.Main camera is also great.Simply one hand phone.But front camera was very poor, its have a 32 MP sensor but still below 8 mp sensor quality.Also slowly oxigen os convert to colour os.Conclusion its a good phone, But not for selfie lovers."
"Phone is good for this price.battery should be improved with updates.6 hours is screen on time on an average. Rest camera is good,could have been better but that ok with this price.charging is super fast.let see it after six months.I feel in this price range of 30 k this is best phone.if you invest more money u get much better options."
"This is the best phone in the range of 20K to 30K , Battery charging it tremendous response time , with in 15 mints fully charged and battery comes for 1 day for sure , camera quality is good . , if we purchase oneplus  nord2  no need of Apple"
Overall i am not satisfied with the product. On normal usage heating issues as if phone is going to explode and batter backup is very poor. I restart the device and it cools down. May be they might fix these issues in coming updates. I will update my review once the problem is solved.
"No camera quality even my previous mobile OnePlus 5t have better then nord 2. They have totally copied Oppo.verry disappointed. I will never recomend this to anyone, don't know what happened to OnePlus's qualities.only OnePlus Tag is original rest entire thing are like oppo."
JUst after unboxing moble switches off randomly on high volume and beacuse of this unable to receive call. Upon raising return and refund claim there is no option of retuning only replacement which is also not easy to claim. Amazon support team initally fools you saying that the troubleshooting technician has resolved the issue but when produced the copy of technician feedback they agree for replacement and not return. Very disappointed with the trust of purchasing from Amazon.
Battery is major problem. It drain so fast. Using device from 10th Oct 21 only 2days went and it started draining.I have not used device for 6-7hrs and found it drops 40-50% .It doesn't worth to buy if u have charge every twice a day.And same problem with one my friend with Nord2.Will put for replacement/refund if still it continues for next 2 days.This is new issue with all above OnePlus 8T devices.
Sometimes finger print doesn't show on the lock screen. Battery drains end of the day on normal use. Rear camera is very good. But front camera is below expectations. Speaker is very good and gives surrounding sound as well.
Within first 30days the phone starts hanging....lagging.....If an app is open in back-end on which video is playing we can stillHear it even if we have other application open.
"Google dialer and sms app is worst, missed call notification still shows even though we open dialer.Selfie app is not good.Camera quality is pathetic at this price.Taking lot of time to delete files.I regret for buying this mobile.No proper wallpaper and lockscreen themes."
"Loved every bit of the phone ... My only negative view is about the integration of Oxygen OS with Colour OS.The camera is amazing, especially the video and night mode .Charging is fast and no noticeable amount of heating during charging.Screen quality is good . Got 2 updates so far for camera stabibily , system stability and security patch .Good product .. I loved the blue colour."
"I am using Nord 2 from last three months. Performance is so well. Smooth functioning, camera quality is quite enough, charged in almost 15-20 mins, once charged phone can use upto 1-1/2 day which is better in 35K. But after usage of camera for long time, any heavy app usage and direct sun contact lead to increasing temp of phone. Actually this is issue with most of the smartphones. We can avoid of using too much. Rest of the things fine"
Okok
कोई मत लेना भाई कतई बकवास घटिया फ़ोन बनाया है पूरे पैसे बर्बाद किसी का काम का नही है इतना heating issue है इसमें जिसकी कोई हद नही इस से अच्छा मेरा last phone MI था। Heating issueकी वजह से जबरदस्त hang भी होता है। Even you can't play pubg game. It's hang with start button when we open main menu.
I was not in knowing that OnePlus Nord 2 could have that much issues1. Front camera is not good2. Battey life is 0%3. Phone gets hangedThe only thing OnePlus Nord 2 have is the Phone gets charged within no time but overall  its waste of money
"Its a justify statement that this phone has proved to be the premium one because of its quality, looks, camera and off course battery. Its the second premium affordable brand that any middle class human can flaunt like a king."
"It seems goal of OnePlus is to only sell the product, after that it's responsibility ends. If device gets damaged, getting faster and quick service is beyond imagination. First of all, They have negligible no of service center as compared to number of devices they are selling. Then existing service center can't serve, because it going under construction ( as I was told at Patna service center). Then repair request service offered on website is too slow."
Fingerprint reader and face lock both are amazing and battery works really efficiently and the camera quality is also fine. It can be said that it's camera quality is weaker than Google Pixel 4a. If someone is looking for camera quality then you should go with pixel 4a. It's performance while playing games is fabulous. Personally speaking that the phone may be big but it is very handy and you can believe it and it feals very luxurious when I use it.
"All good except the heatingthe phone get heat while charging or doing some multitasking.camera is goodbut what you feel is oneplus software is not uniqueyou will find the same interface in all the redmi, oppo, vivo phones"
Battery life is amazing. Fingerprint reader is quick. Camera quality is a+. Selfie camera could have been better in terms of pixels but it's good. A friend bought it and he is happy with the purchase. Definitely better than an expensive iphone.
Phone looks great it's not too heavy quite handy as well.The fingerprint sensor is quite good you does not need to press for a long time. The battery lasts up to 10 to 12 hours with continue usage like if u watch video stuffs and all. It has 65 W charging capacity so it hardly takes 20 min for full charging. Picture quality is amazing. Although I am using this phone from past 1 week there is no heating issue till now. Worth buying this phone.
"Nord 2 is my first mobile from OnePlus and seriously the looks and build quality is awesome. I bought 8,128 gb and it does not lack I can feel the refresh rate of 90hz and the smoothness while using camera and everything. I'm not game liver so I don't know how this device perform playing game. But OnePlus should improve the quality of front camera in this price range there should be 4k recording in front camera, rest all is good for me."
"Pros:Nice FinishBack cameraSuperfast chargingCons:No memory Card slotFront camera could be betterFew bugs to be resolvedWorks like a sharp knife on the butter.No complaint, a VFM product.Adding few camera samples"
"Battery life is good enough..charges up very fast too...camera quality is also good..focus is a bit off colour, edge detection  is decent in portrait mode. Fingerprint reader and face unlock is slow as compared to other phones in this segment..heats a bit while charging and gaming.. brightnes is good..screen sampling would have been much better at 120hz..overall good phone if u manage to take it below 27-28k"
"Phone is really good, but the quality is really doubtful as my phone display broken from a fall of nearly 3 feet. Warranty doesn't cover physical damage. Paid ₹8432 for new display."
1. Earphone detection problem.2. Mediatek processor is not capable of multitasking.3. Camera not as much appreciable as said AI technology.4. Many more but not in a mood to add

I switched from I-Phone to One Plus few months back but the experience has not been good. There is a lot of lag on the current OS and at time the screen goes black while attending calls and the only way to go back to screen is to reboot OS The overall interface is clumsy and non receptive at times. This product is not a value for your money .
A very over rated and hyped phone from oneplus. It has battery life of just 3 hours which is almost nothing. Even the screentouch often misses to register the touch. Sometimes even the keyboard doesn't open when i click to type. A very bad choice which i just regret. Would have returned this product but unfortunately the 7 days period got over from Amazon.
Camera is amazing needs some improvement .65 watt charger very good ..go for it without tainsion
One of the best smartphone there is no issue about battery blast I m a hard core gamer i play game more than 5 hour but battery doesn't heat that much you won't believe how many juice left I'm not a OnePlus guy or anyone promoted me but trust me this phone is extremely needed if you want a phone with good camera and do some gaming or any personal work it won't let you down.
